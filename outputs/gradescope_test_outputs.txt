So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this was <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take away from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart disease, <unk>
So you're thinking that you have high cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most intractable drugs in the world today, you are even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should have to ask for the most doctors don't want to talk about, and companies companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It is the number of people who have to take a drug or attack surgery in any medical procedure before they help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not tell me something if not to help me.
But medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's <unk> it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs works just about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the more widely <unk> which believe it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they stop a single heart attack, brain spill or a <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why no <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you need to ask ourselves for one more statistic and it is, you know, the <unk> effects. Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, low stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how you can do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out of the drug of the drug that will help you the drug.
I don't say you should or not take the <unk>
I just say you have to have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
They're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
To the surgery that is more done in the top men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to try is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a choice many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face 2 Face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react quickly. You could get to be the lunch for lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought, like, <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail instead of time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that help to minimize harm, or to prevent bad things in the first place.
I went down to the night of snow in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor with a combination of combination with the gate, with a key to the gate door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't read and lots and lots of messages I haven't read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Wow. <unk> is my favorite character.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there it looks like it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> it can be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time of time, he mixed up with local dishes, and developed the language we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person living in a world of sound, it is as if I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
It was <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people read about.
So I have learned for example.
"Not <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure that you weren't <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound -- the sound that's coming to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
Let's go ahead and go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through subtle <unk> and <unk>
In the culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that's not natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, all of it was <unk>
Now sound has come into my territory of art.
It goes to me more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be that way.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all they had taught me how much to sound, I decided to leave it and get it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I introduced it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency <unk>
In my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that it could well be brought to me and my artistic work -- or I could <unk>
I chose to get me wrong.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is as if it had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could <unk> in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and to express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said to be said in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> split up in many different <unk> <unk>
If you calculated a different parameter for each finger as the facial expression, the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the way of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it was <unk> just a key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a very clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only a key would change in <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters you can express different ideas.
So for instance, the signal would take me in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you take it down, and you get the speed speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can say the same thing to be said goodbye.
"All tonight."
This is all night, in this picture.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> tonight."
I feel the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
And this represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically as <unk>
Look at <unk> hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
Everyone with your hands.
We're now going to do it as much in your head as a chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please give you back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in the head and the chest but they transmit very different meanings to see it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and lives -- just like music.
However, today, we live in a very troubled world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have sounds, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> you don't need to hear music to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to ask you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can get everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble bubble -- I must say, because adults lied to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up each other.
The country, the country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizens of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of waste.
So as a good citizens, I would get the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these large ships and networks, and then gather those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But hard for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny room in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> job <unk> so that the children very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take an image of this <unk> the kids would get a lot of the robots.
Then we create quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light lights and chambers in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board and process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get a estimate of how many plastic in the water.
I took this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're trying to be trying to fix it immediately.
I was able to research my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
So you see the news, you look at the Internet, and you have this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, only using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that you get to the water where the water is where you live in.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil is also from brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different spectra what can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help a remote form to other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it took several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power station near the water.
And today, according to the reports for an average of 300 tons still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like the majority of the radiation disappeared from the coast -- and the vast majority of time, it has safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> of course not <unk>
But every night you go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of their life.
Together with them we discussed the <unk> data that day, and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a map of <unk> <unk> of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> introduced <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition to the nearest nuclear <unk> to date.
We approaching a mile of nuclear center, and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a remote problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with the open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's at the heart of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, so you can basically build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become true of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked questions like, we can invent the future of mobility with embodied energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility in the age of age transforming their standard <unk> on new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the kids in the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizen scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation for the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different opposite design.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk thread in a <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic <unk>
One is the middle of the environment, the other thing he thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other one by it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> in <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only of Michelangelo.
But the living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information to take it for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production in mass.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think about their objects, as <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in the wild.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts mostly like filter the other mostly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the <unk> personality of every single designer and an architect in working on the <unk> and the organism, between the machine, and the organism, between the assembly and the growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere shows in the two screens behind me.
My job at its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly assembly and coming up to growth.
You probably ask you why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment -- where I got four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believe in.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, products, and tools and tools and tools and tools and tools like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 feet from diameter with a <unk> base that someday you can print <unk> buildings and graphics to the nanoscale made <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where each size is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made from one single piece, <unk> in the <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D <unk> no seams between cells -- let me show more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> and <unk> <unk> resolution.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an fMRI scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and the <unk> instruments that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair and perhaps comfortable and also absorb sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, we came back to nature for <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
We put this surface on the surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, and color points in the human body.
And the surface, like nature varies its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the property property.
But it's the <unk> nature of it.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't even grew up in a religious Jewish home but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them became and actually define a lot of what I care about.
Like her <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk>
And for that first tree there -- there would be no difference between trunk, branches and leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made the trees growing trees with <unk> <unk> you can and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were made of a single part?
Get it to a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the <unk> material that was the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like <unk> quote, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into the <unk> your properties, we could generate structures that are <unk> on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a bunch of seed husks the <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
We replace chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, very hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built up with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures made out of one single material material -- long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, you let it dry to find a natural form of contact with air.
So why do we keep designing <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which first appeared on the planet -- a billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we <unk> the bacteria designed to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition out of <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even more, to windows.
A tree is <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of seed husks in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> on the sea, and the <unk> life -- and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for the <unk>
To do that, we need to master the bacteria and control their flow.
And as the <unk> board, we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you get two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and on fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacterium that lives in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other use sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help us to <unk> these bacteria and to get their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, and we will make the properties of material that is the material of material as well.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, it <unk> more transparent.
This <unk> system <unk> when it stretches from one end to another one, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> bright channels with life within the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are middle-aged creatures -- it's only half a <unk>
What if the design would have the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we were able to create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the inevitable tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture in a home which is <unk>
<unk> is not going to make this level of <unk>
It does it by combination of two material, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, take those fibers on each other.
And this happens across scales.
The very first silk worm is happening in the environment, it creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a tiny magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with MRI sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat map, not within a box, we realized that we would take a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that shape, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
And you often have the silk worms to death inside your <unk> your silk <unk> and you use it in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we could shape the <unk> silk, without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms into the darkest areas and this is why we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the ray of light, and the heat will indicate the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to receive <unk>
We asked the silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to fill them with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and while they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
In <unk> biological silk about quantum <unk> <unk> all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, we have <unk> silk worms <unk>
In a curious curiosity that this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a two material ecology designers must bring these two visions of world together.
What brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of the creation, that leads to a design inspired by nature inspired by the very first time, which demands for us, for the first time, that we have in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever asked you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused you some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I am someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and performed web sites, played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general I like to try and persist anyway, to have dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I joined the other thing, something completely different, and I was excited about it, and I'm going to leave you in it, and I feel <unk> I have found that <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give you up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad in me for not to forget about it.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me then.
Ask themselves, where learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you did it, the learned of culture.
What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody matters what they were doing at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
This question gets us over and over again as we grow in various ways -- you know, you know, <unk> into high school students are asking you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, not inspires to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it just does the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are <unk> maybe they get sick and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> publisher of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative design.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or true <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And I feel there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
I could help if you divide in three parts: multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can also use other terms that you would take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was very good at multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
They make any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or woe you need to win.
But what I've learned to talk about with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths from being in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization, of data, travel, math and design, when they started <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates gold <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea unique because of his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
innovation happens at intersections.
And that's coming out of the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all its background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower, <unk> is rapid learning.
When we <unk> it <unk> we are going to do it.
We look at all that we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
And so many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to each new area that we would do, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
As a child pianist to <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she is the fastest familiar <unk>
Before he turned into a writer, I was <unk> in the financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales of sales when he was starting their practices, and this ability to write another compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to get to what you would do, even if at the end of the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third <unk> <unk> is adaptability.  That is, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos and a web designer designer -- sometimes consultant to a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take various <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs to meet the market needs, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if you're a pressure to reduce your targets.
As a society, we have a big interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems -- <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers not conventional to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get into a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in deep and put into ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are dealing with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part are encouraging them to simply be more like their peers <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope that it is this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart company, then you would have all the media.
That's where you give the best of you.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes, I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Let's get the intersections.
<unk> our internal <unk> leads us to a <unk> and happy life.
And perhaps the most important thing, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year he was <unk> to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric psychiatric hospital.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for she until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, he <unk> he did a <unk> and they found strange and <unk> plates in the <unk> brain.
The most amazing thing.
If you were living today, you couldn't give her more help than the one who <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines for protecting us from infections, lots of treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV and <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But gradually it has been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it'll affect 150 million who, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the ability to Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the chance that you spend your years with Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's.
Just in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in Alzheimer's.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- a <unk> increase in the year 2050, of course, as the <unk> generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be <unk> to cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we spend less time and money on the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research than Alzheimer's -- despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a number of annual number of deaths like cancer.
<unk> is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time we know -- but the whole world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us, all of us, the scientists, even the scientists, Alzheimer's, with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only looking at a picture of a healthy human brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger severe memory loss and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's, found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century century.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that it folds like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these dots are <unk> they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules are beating each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
You can do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that goes on and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have been brought down the cables and you expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> -- physicists and engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, they have protein molecules that they stick with each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of late, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We should argue that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have featured more research and <unk> pressure on governments and pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and caregivers and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain is running the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
And so we talked about them, and they will help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times column in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when we tested it as I was a night last summer.
And so the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers were <unk> to get 36 questions more and more personal and then they look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake tomorrow with one quality or skill, which would be?
Number one: When was the last time you would ask someone else to someone else was.
And <unk>
And so we <unk> these are becoming more and more personal.
Number two: <unk> really excited about your partner what you like to do or her, or it was very honest at this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say someone you've never met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone that I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we <unk> and   and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the spinal <unk>
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you probably wondering, do you still go there?
And the reason I think I was going to do -- this is because you've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had <unk> myself to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But one blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand <unk>
And that took a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was posted on Friday on Friday at night, and the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And I had been called the Today, Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received over eight million <unk> and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing by experiences that are passionate about, but another thing is to discover that loving life has been given -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: Still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
And I actually gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put it red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should wait for people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't ready for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
We put on television interviews, and we would bring them to pictures of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real, real, love love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, mostly that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for foster <unk> between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing -- several later studies, also used <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction among strangers.
They've been using it between members of the police and community, and they've used them with people of the opposite political ideologies people.
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately he never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a <unk> liberal arts university and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> I tried to study the study and didn't work.
He looked like <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to tell you about the person who you would do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that I know managed to get better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was basically all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I focus on science.
And I did all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could a certain form -- the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was just talking about the book I was writing at, but in hindsight, it seems to be <unk>
I thought if I was built with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful from one or a different way.
I am a patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what we <unk>
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you reasonably demand me by me.
What I'm looking for about love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in a way to mitigate some of the risk <unk> and this is a very controversial story, because in love with us feeling beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that asks, still follow together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, I would propose to make questions more difficult, questions like, "How do you decide who your love deserves your love and who not?
How to stay in love when things are <unk> and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your mate?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, and we are still together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little one to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I had not considered anything that was supposed to be there.
It didn't mean how many times we would take that decision, and how much times will you have to keep doing that choice without knowing if he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded for 36 questions, I have chosen to love somebody so generous, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe really.
And what I'm going to do, and what maybe spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my article, which is, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the chance to choose someone, and the hope that he would also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> in full mountain, and in a certain way I got as a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York is a time.  One of the things that really affected me but more detail later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
He took a box of wood, and he <unk> a ticket ticket a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, like, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At one point I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from board and <unk> and all of those things, and I was making a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took up all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> the style of the style -- she Martin, the covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> and so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite is the opposite of a way that it seemed to be growing up, as if it was that I had the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
So this time, I started to add some electronic elements to add some strange plastic elements that I could find out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow by drawing as it does about a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, you will say that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in the human way, sculptures of <unk> sculptures of human beings with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because <unk> was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to drawing it in a window, then in another window, and another <unk> and he had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big -- that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired as much as "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> kilos.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit awkward.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a holy god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform -- <unk> <unk> shelter -- there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, as a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird bird, and spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail changes the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go -- you know.
His tail ends up in a top-down balloon made of Mother's Mother's cards.
You have <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
It takes me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each of us is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be successful or magazines.
But each other acts as a kind of archive in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being caught inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest <unk>
I'm going to meet you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has is a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a site in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just the ones that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> That's called <unk> <unk>
Inside this box is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a writer a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a <unk> a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world -- and a garden.
It turns out the box and all the people in the face hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you're <unk> who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first happens by our stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug will actually affect the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> every single drug gets sick.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these serve to decrease the number of viruses in blood, and to increase the stem cells.
But they are also known to their side effects of their side effects on their most negative, because in the time they take to get to the current current -- they become <unk> and worse even over the time that they take to get to their destiny, which is where it's most important, in the <unk>
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily into the blood vessel of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with today's drugs that is a treatment of life <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "You know, we can get the treatment directly to the warehouse store without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for care of wounds and <unk> surgery, you can use it for anything else -- including <unk> <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open up and closing almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asked, "How is that <unk>
So we sent a little bit and powerful beam laser beam over the cell membrane with HIV as these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro -- or on plates of <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> You can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a very three head.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, which is going to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of the infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look like a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of a researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
Over the last decade, I've been studying armed groups and armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these police agents in violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation not violent.
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding to these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements of peace and 2011, and 2011, <unk> had signed between a state and an actor not government.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they ask how they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and the political struggle are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> <unk> in Israel, also runs the Gaza of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
We have a complex machinery of communication stations radio channels, web channels of the Internet and strategies of the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here they have <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising.
These are <unk>
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit them better and build their brand.
Local groups are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
The schools, run schools, run hospitals, put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
Social groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't care and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by the war or even the principle of the rise of <unk> can be understood by the efforts of these groups to deliver safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated legal price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a void, a <unk> gap by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the refugee victory of 2006 <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage in the West, even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they were feeding gaps by government, and they come up as armed and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and the more complex are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How would you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all of its <unk> collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of states without state and hybrids and the more weak the states, like in the Middle East, more intervene and fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in tools not military tools.
<unk> that brand of government has to be at the heart of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better groups, we will understand what incentives to offer to boost the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> military power can win some battles, but we don't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of security, to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the sticker of <unk> would be <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was overwhelmed with a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews the people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young woman, especially in my youth and the 20 years I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that <unk> sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in the <unk> which might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as well as <unk> or violence.
We have right to use it in a very easy way and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to figure out our other <unk>
We are not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression.
We need to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a whole bunch of things that make me a feminist.
I have another confession.
When I'm driving to work, I hear rap music <unk> all volume.
Even though the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> classic of the yin yang is amazing.
Do you really have your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get rid of the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely overwhelmed by my musical wish.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all of the tasks that I don't want to do, but also killing insects -- the <unk> <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
It comes out of fashion journals.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> of <unk> fairy tales that they do.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his election, and I'm not the one who <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically financially vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are <unk> so that women are vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
The conventional Feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically, the needs of women of color, and workers, gay women and <unk> for white, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens the following: As a geneticist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we would have perfection.
When we were excited about taking them with a lot of taste in the same <unk> where they <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider that <unk> of that <unk> before you try to put in there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a <unk> fear of what is that <unk> fear of not being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three meters tall.
It was a <unk> spectacle to see that pop star will embrace Feminism and to know the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless debates if it was or not just a feminist.
They took their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much to do very much.
We go much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it doesn't stay anything.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or most good, more inclusive Feminism is the point of <unk>
But what's next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be happier to provide a reproductive supply.
These artists don't change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting their profits.
No doubt is hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions make it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> in three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and shiny and so brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
It's where you get rid of the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men -- they can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, participating in his project, or working with you, until it doesn't include enough number of women, so much to be able to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also force them to be including even more like us as well as we can be educated to overcome the barriers to the consumer jobs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts without taking these <unk> our achievements to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top of people in the power of their power and theater producers and music and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and significant change.
We can also claim to bravery our feminism, -- well, bad, or <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because I got my voice to me, and Feminism was a <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids would tell me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I had my voice, and after everything I didn't tell me I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I joined a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and project, I also discovered that if it was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell you we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other one, I claim the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad poet. I am a good poet. I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need a bit of a courage.
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had measles because he visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be terrible for a child with a immune immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked controversial about autism and vaccines were <unk> and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines caused autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she believed to develop his entire life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates kept a stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> from fundraising.
What's going on?
If they're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control what is going on, what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnostic diagnosis and <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking at the face of his son of two years, visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to come in, why were they so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article which described 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around her around me, even their own parents.
They could do fun for hours by waving their hands before their face, but they were <unk> from panic for <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of its syndrome as we collect references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine from every 10 children to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of acute child is caused by foreign parents.
And these kids, he said, they kept them carefully in a fridge that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two.
When his mother got one of his favorite records, he was properly said, <unk>
But <unk> I had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the kids were just simply <unk> what they heard their parents are desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning it into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, which researchers started to test the theory theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist thought that the theory of mentor mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as no support, no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for young boys and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of HIV prevalence in the general population.
I had a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was a lot more <unk> and diverse life.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, whereas others were engaged in their fascination with astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or the genealogy of <unk>
In the other way, these kids didn't fit into beautiful squares and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had no <unk> of these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the <unk> of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation in the English, but luckily, the husband from <unk> was talking German, and he would put it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Asperger's who was running a integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in the clinic started with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of autism, Asperger's as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse fraction of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as a awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was more there even until the success in science and art, a ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes were not in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between us to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four prize from <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents all over the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced the first easy clinical trial to use to diagnose autism.
I had no longer to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect <unk> a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected that it were, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
And then Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the increase in diagnosis.
If the current estimate of the prevention of prevention that one in 68 children in America are right in the spectrum, it's right, <unk> are one of the world's largest largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are linked on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving new medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to today's standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit to details.
Indeed, people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most severe aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all of the hands in cover to <unk> the boat <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
