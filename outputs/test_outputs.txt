You know what I do is write for the children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, and I read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can tell you as farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell down somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a circle which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When he was beaten up to her every week in the men's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me enter the bathroom <unk>
I do it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who fought against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults never came to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to lie with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see it, and we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> us from her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he became a <unk> box, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from it.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of the life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm really happy that I talked about this today.
It also needs to -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I will put them around my <unk> of water almost 60 feet and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> over another <unk> over a year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to refuse and hold up until the end of the end, while others can't afford more, and they were <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> which are isolated separated and alone, in large as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> it melts I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg ice releases water freshwater that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its path for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's little frequent to actually see a <unk> <unk>
Here you have.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of her personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine you imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about yourself -- I'm not going to pay attention to you.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined by the X X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X chromosome joined the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that turned two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people think about the anatomy -- that means of human bodies, and <unk> how they have regarded the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit in the male male and female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of shapes.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having sex that you don't know, in the male and <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which has the <unk> gene from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that they become <unk>
And then, in the life, the testes are producing testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there are high testosterone levels but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops in a course, a <unk>
When you get older, the baby looks like a child.
It's a young girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is going on.
After making tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like I -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know its <unk> structure, I think it's a typical typical woman most women as I am sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles who have <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. Not the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and he had just found out he had <unk> and womb.
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and the uterus <unk> <unk> were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone and typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was 19 years old when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with ancient chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> which is that they have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So there are lots of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- to be <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> <unk> surgery -- it's not to be able to provide them from a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they were involved with several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy has <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very strong ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children born as two people in one single body.
The most high case is last year with the South African South African <unk> <unk> <unk> has been <unk> his sex on the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to ask wonder, "What do you test to determine whether you're going to be <unk> it's a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the journalists that don't exist as a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated we need to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- which we thought was a stable bacterial categories that are <unk> directly with bacterial categories -- they're much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology did.
So as we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What did you mean from the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we thrive in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> probably are too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, they're the struggles at first, and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but within <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to stand with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of people put a pen in front of the nose, and if it moved still not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to address the prisoner's dilemma -- and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
And in politics I'm a liberal, I claim to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to me so much.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we were in the way we were going on.
It was from the concept point of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent fan of parents who are <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical, in what they did, that I find every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the parents <unk>
The parents were <unk> they were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and they put it with another one which was radical and beautiful for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents were, <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they could get the political power to the right of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They went through the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were being thrown out of two things.
And it was <unk> democracy and at the same time to make science.
And there is very clear -- if you look at the story of parents, <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power being passed by a <unk> idea of <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And by doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement of <unk>
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, the people of color that we get to coincidence <unk> about the <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at them, we have to start asking questions why we sustain certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some divisions <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should take it before anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five year-old children were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some divisions <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before <unk> June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term: August 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right -- the right -- the right -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for everything not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, so by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on its hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science took so much in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For instance, Texas has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have a chromosome, and that to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make their exams, they prescribe people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of Capgras syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding parents from modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but on the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I am not sure that I had to take care of it in this to love people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some human beings I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> intelligent and <unk> about their sex relationships that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the contents of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me is what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an MRI.
We really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of thinking about what democracy is.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they are willing to join a change of sex, in which case they can live.
We are not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that he had made a little couple of thousand years ago to then pick it out, and so <unk> his <unk>
But when the phone asked the reason for the <unk> operation -- a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country, these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change because of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to end up I want to say I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to tell you a little radical thing for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in Feminism -- I considered a <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing women's in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about her question, the more you have a little female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more excited about complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very excited to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that they had gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more in the relationships.
So as we try to create a better <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily take it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just replaced by buildings from apartments.
Imagine the half of those who wanted to live in apartment -- they were owners and that the other half will still supply to do it.
You could try to increase the capacity by doing <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a fully new, build a completely new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place we would find the construction instead of <unk>
So I proposed that governments to come up with new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following elections, they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> led to a platform where <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and look at all the current residents in apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually these are the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
And they said, "Did this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, we met a conference room in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract debate, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> came to me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to get a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that would be able to start with a site that would be used at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The head of the Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have it here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed me the <unk>
And this explained to me that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be an option in a city that could be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the Afghan government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that help us establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could fill in a thousand square miles.
And shortly after the 19th of January, they voted in Congress to put her Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow us to create these special special regions.
In a country that had just gone through this crisis called voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> that was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in the society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February was passed over again in another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of the voting to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in building in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new heart center in the city that is building in Korea larger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after it was four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this way, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow <unk> <unk> and once it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow her Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've been solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There's a lot of companies who wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to get a job -- and sometimes they are mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to be thinking about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a <unk> and that is that I live obsessed with antibodies.
I love to find, both and more recently, photograph and post and post in my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> and <unk> stores.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are usually my money going to a good <unk> and my view is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I won.
Going back to the topic of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what bring someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know me as a woman who walks at TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the print for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to use new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
I call this tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it was <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get rid of you, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you get in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to be playing <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like to go and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there's no look you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A true universal truth for you: The golden <unk> are all with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> <unk> and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously, this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, and I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to bother these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> and colorful colorful and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brains.
For instance, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be totally intuitive.
So where do you make your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like that, with a great <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to solve these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed with the journey of the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in a place at once.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, he was always <unk>
But I bet the game playing with that parking lot, he taught a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a physicist, because they don't play with a parking <unk> they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they make all kinds of really weird things -- as they can go through walls, or can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of a few years ago, you needed of quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you don't need you to describe the great objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But they didn't fit well to my logical side.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles follow quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason I shouldn't have.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I set out to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip here.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom here a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here we do a very good focus on the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal and a springboard and a springboard and also supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip again, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how much to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up, let me do those things, because I don't want you to accept it, or, actually, you know.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The peers on inanimate objects are not only people -- it's the light that goes down and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to communicate from quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and we pulled out all the air -- and then we put it down at a temperature of less than a degree for absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like you.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very weird ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was <unk> and the way he <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when we give it a <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that I don't belong to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing is not going to be <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of these trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and on the bottom.
It's just on certain <unk> when those <unk>
The rest of the time is <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was a clean room in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, you know, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between the metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my kind of logic I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how do that be that?
How do you acting your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it up, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there on one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about talking about that quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that is here and let me take it out.
I took 18 months old.
And so many negotiations and stories, they were going to do it with 17 very interesting museums in nine different countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining to just this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
It was <unk> of a great education, not me, but I had no access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go into museums, and I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you the demo, and then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click up, and we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you get away.
They want to navigate by the <unk>
So we open the top, and with one click on the top, we click on it.
You want to go in the end of the hall,
They're going forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually get to 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems like <unk>
And I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I had a little bit recently talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which consists of hitting a <unk> with a bottle of <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is a painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how they van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and really the thing that goes on.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is <unk>
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create their own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple -- I've created this function that I call <unk> the power of <unk> -- we've just got a zooming in around.
This is <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery, in London.
You can write things, you send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you think about contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital digital does justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that makes me today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel in flying away.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting in <unk> careers one in the last two decades.
It's already some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, take a budget and you put it into a good pilot and a good car, a good car.
And if the pilot and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, we have real control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing today is that the real control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and <unk>
They're becoming computers in the open.
And as <unk> are starting to answer a different way and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a certain note, I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the <unk> consumption -- and even 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction as we humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end of the <unk> he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- he still can see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you only about <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and driving something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup book.
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, he won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
In the late afternoon, there are people standing here and doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people have a quick call and go in the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First of all, <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night they were all <unk> to the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner of the winner -- the winner and the prime minister of the time.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the place of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> <unk> people will <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in its shift in the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what were different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are in all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist before.
They're going on things complicated and there is a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every single day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't absorb is still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle we <unk> on one day is still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is driving about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves and <unk> valves and <unk> and <unk>
It creates as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you go down the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, <unk>
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so we can see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked a lot.
And they set up a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call this a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors no windows, but when you approach it open, it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building, and all architecture goes to like in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you slow down all the architecture away.
This is how it works.
You see people who are going on with what's going on in.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to leave you up, but a building that was still making <unk> and holes in water and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people are using.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with others in sync.
We could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this cloud, and we could form this
A kind of flexible screen like this with normal configuration, in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different type.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, and different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a 3D pixels in 3D that you can reach, and you can see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to a <unk> like before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with one entry that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of the New York City star and the <unk> of <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left -- you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as it <unk>
It can do it all the movement.
You can walk along the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and the <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our <unk> environment as a farm farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign would tell us, we can move from the digital world, of the power of networks, to physical world.
In our case, this might we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think of climate change or CO2 emissions. How do we move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get there.
As a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a matter of change in your genes, you could improve it by a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, you will be stronger to be more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of themselves?
What about living with good health?
Or maybe you're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you most passionate about.
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk>
Raise your hand.
<unk> probably had to be the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many people do memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel good as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference but I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense except for the light of the <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It comes to the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, all of this branch, is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
At the time, there's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here a few years old.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but in reality, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin which is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the most bacteria that the cells we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> do the <unk> they think about the <unk>
The gut is an beautifully correlated environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dark <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that they can want without effort in their own.
It's really like a quick move for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some <unk> <unk> to the output.
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients and <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would we tell the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is as a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique <unk> and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope that you have <unk>
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in organisms -- each cell just divide and all the genetic energy from that cell is transferred to the two daughters cells.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes in evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have a confession to confess that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death for <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every single more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still went in Las Vegas in his 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door to hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a gorgeous dancer, a slight dancer, of clothes.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> look for a <unk> <unk>
"Yes, he says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get healthy to us.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of moving the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everybody <unk> the feeling of Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my job.
I want to be <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily apply to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily hold the biggest or the stronger or the fastest even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish there -- a little bit of a empty fish -- but they have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the argument behind us would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and spread out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we were going to get to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it's no longer possible to have the evolution of evolution.
A second possibility is that there's a evolution of the traditional kind, natural type, dictate by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when the species -- distant planets are going to exist isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing and intriguing possibility to be a terrifying thing.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> by us as individuals in the choices that they <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First you consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to both and family and familiar.
Think also that if it could be able to choose not only the sex of its <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic change to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13.
<unk> billion dollars.
By the next year, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of 20,000 and a week.
It won't be a lot of the way that the human genome will actually make the human genome -- and will be increasingly in the reach of all.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can <unk> viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to engage with them immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine grown into a plant of <unk>
Can you imagine something nice that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only other two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes -- reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of spending this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take a hundred years old, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We are going to use these choices to make a better society better, more successful.
Or, we're going to choose selectively <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably <unk> some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three minutes later, at the same time.
The pilot took the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the <unk>
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. The life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never implemented.
As I was thinking about that, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also gives place to my ego.
And I am sorry for the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels about <unk>
I don't try to have the reason why it is <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14 <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be used in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I was born, I had the feeling of, Whoa! I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk> --  And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was all the reason for the world.
At that point I was connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was <unk> a miracle, of not dying that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and live again.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens on your airplane -- and please not be like that, but imagine, and how do you start?
What is it that they are expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and he said, "Dad, I feel <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So I went and met her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and you have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they communicate with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I introduced to me with the only desire to deliver a check and rather than that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I committed her brother and her father at that very moment, right, "All right, this is the Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside their inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- they draw about that and record negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First they start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the coffee attacks, and in the end, people start making art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And a couple of years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot of organization to move things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of insurance companies and we get a machine to <unk> I could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from all over the corner of the world to our home.
My wife, and I moved to the garage of the back and these hackers and programmers and clinics, took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken the squares of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks old, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a couple of <unk> <unk> we buy in the shipping of <unk> Beach, something of copper and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on an LED light, and there's now a device that is free -- we published a <unk> we published the software <unk> the software is low for free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says <unk>
There is no hospital that can say <unk>
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning -- two weeks of training, of all night, Tony turned to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed down the bed to see it.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for her family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we were feeling like we were playing, the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time I was to draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and they would get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream at war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and so much robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 highest inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the center of Los Angeles -- in Los Angeles -- there's going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you look at something that isn't possible, we do it possible.
Nothing in this room is possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, you know, if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I have spent the last few years in <unk> in the situations that are generally difficult and at the same time a so dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in hard and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days to eat just this fun -- which is difficult in the middle, which is very dangerous to the end of the end.
In fact, in great part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations horrible situations with the only goal of trying to look at social issues of social issues that are interesting -- and hopefully analyzing them in a way that they look kind of playful and accessible to the audience.
So when I learned that I would come up here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent a few messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was doing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to the content that you have no idea what it is and according to the content I might think about it, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good opportunity to do that.
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I had no opportunity for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I have been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be so difficult or as dangerous as to enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to do a film that tries to do about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The biggest film <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that everything on top at the bottom end, it has images from <unk> all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title -- the <unk> brand.
Now this brand, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people laughed at the film for <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the brand of <unk> brand in the title but we're going to make sure that we're going to give you all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and you get the most cool shoe you <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you've <unk> from <unk> from "The largest movie <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the marks as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is full transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole thing, all of the shot at beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people in that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth trying to convince a couple of big ones.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time you go out and look at us like a bunch of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most answers.
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> for the film or being me?
JK:
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as much people as possible, to make as many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the scenario of separate media, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that will take the message to <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
No, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president <unk> even the <unk> <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> --  -- like that weird bear that still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want it to be <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but you want to be <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was stuck in a lie -- and he's staring at him as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the real-time story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that was just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take a proxy and go to companies myself with my team.
So what I started to realize is a sudden, and I started to give me a lot of <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, large, giant films, and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood films -- giant Hollywood films, they say the reason their movies have so much success because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these large, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The biggest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I open up every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say you're good cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you with you."
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have its opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> <unk> to <unk> as it is.
That's the big look.
Now I can answer their questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We are a little brand.
They put into the kind of smaller movies that we are doing -- we're rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people about the reason that this is why we are interested.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something bold <unk>
I think it's a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps it cool.
How do you keep keeping you better, better <unk> more than three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man in the street, and the people like me, the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good guys.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like that.
Usually I wear accessories like <unk> or the <unk> or the same thing.
Woman: If you were able to be a brand like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: And so I hippie it in part part of <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet <unk>
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is idiots.
Man 5: We have <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom but I often lie in the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a family photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These shape people, my way to see the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you think about as people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case where they come from. And they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your be?
MS: It's like who I would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: <unk> of the <unk> to what do you do that?
What's the <unk> What phase is you find now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
And we got a little bit about that.
<unk> more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> Have you <unk>
You don't have to be frightened. What kind of mountain mountain for?
MS: <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Big <unk> Yeah. <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think a few companies will only become one of their strong points or the other rather than focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements and you are actually <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the Apple <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> brand. What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to <unk> your brand identity, your personality <unk> what would be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> attribute to you.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like being playful <unk> like <unk> contemporary <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or <unk>
Or are you more of <unk> <unk>
Are you conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You are <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are reliable, stable, familiar, safe, <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how we now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for marketing as a film.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden the advertising <unk>
In all the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting their way into the schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I had the biggest answer or where I have more successful is those in which I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do to the people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it gone? Did you have it success?
Well, since the film was sent to the <unk> Film Festival take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not wrong because of all the agencies that we're talking about with <unk> to not be a part.
I've always believed that if you take risks -- if you take risks, that you have opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that that's pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees at the risk averse to risk they're preparing their entire company to lack of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we have to give it place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk>
From a <unk> we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor the transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- has been presented by my good friends from <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> big data on big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, I would think about the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket -- I have a check at the name of the TED <unk> Foundation, the <unk> Foundation for being applied to my assistance for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that see are real control systems in real time.
If we get to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software that are completely different technology.
But if we can put an effective virus from Windows on a laptop laptop using an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with an Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that was known is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes, these <unk> systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was happening with this.
So they spent very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory in lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program you're trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say, for example, a U.S. energy plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better get it to <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and grab the control code, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all the points for the ones to attack.
They probably even know what the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard the <unk> <unk> it's complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this code here.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning, they were calls in the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we were trying to fill it with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need to have theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to the theories of goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be an valuable, and it's probably probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear nuclear power plant, and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and the energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and confuse in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for instance, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it became better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had in our hands.
And so it's not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
We <unk> <unk> in dead <unk> and we had to start again.
Still, we found that both digital <unk> they would say to one single goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about each other targets that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really <unk>
There's the gray, and you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the values of input for example, of pressure sensors and vibration sensors and providing <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding <unk>
It's great news.
The idea here is obviously just <unk> to the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
So for example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes on, you have to open up heat valves in a <unk>
And obviously this can't make it a human operator,
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And no <unk> no security system <unk>
Thank you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with uranium.
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this payload with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms.
Let's make it as possible.
And if we did that, with what they <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces in large number of goals.
We need to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the ultimate <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give <unk> skills or another one that makes you on your wheelchair and you can walk back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something that you put in the morning, it gives you a great force, which is in addition to its speed, and helps you, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on your back a load of 45 pounds, and it's getting <unk> to take even more team.
And obviously this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take 90 kilos for variables for a lot of time.
Your flexible design, it allows you to <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the look at users of the wheelchair, on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people in roughly, in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with often, very young people with the spinal cord that would start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> so quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I may recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a spinal column, and as a result couldn't go back to 19 years old, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has <unk>
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer computer, here on the back.
There are a few batteries that give the motors to the motors in the knees, and the knees, and they make it progress with this very smooth and very natural ride.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when a stranger in the air, on the bottom of the air over the bottom of it was <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all of the feeling and all of the stomachs move down.
Shortly later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you will never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole my last little bit of hope of my being.
<unk> technology has been allowed to learn how to <unk> it costs down to <unk> climbing rocks and even riding rocks in hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just about soldiers, but to all the <unk> users all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice to say hi, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not <unk> Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know about your cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> rainforests of Congo.
<unk> are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living family.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where mortal violence has still hasn't seen before.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of large apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> forest and has been very difficult to get it.
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat trade and deforestation, make it not fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you hear the laughter is that you hear laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know we know it as the ape <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have frequent <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With it, we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the same of laughter, the dance and the human ritual ...
The game is the glue that we come together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have <unk>
Just I think in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common both in Bonobos as well as humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows this video that's really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take lots of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to show you this is a <unk> a young female who is playing with a little bit of <unk> water.
I think that it, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our interior worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curious curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just tiny samples of the understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we need to adapt to a more and more difficult world with creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's take the most of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate play, they can be the moments in which the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting the poverty, we were adding as a captain of captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are going to have highly skilled <unk> you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a race to the other volunteers to get the captain and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that definitely <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and his home was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before I did, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came to first to the captain and he asked him to fit and would save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I went into a <unk> building to save a live living because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and you bring it to this woman a couple shoes."
I promise that.
It wasn't exactly what I was waiting for, but I was going on the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the firemen <unk> that at the height of that height or less had finished off the fire and went into the top room search for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back down the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
I went from the house to the home owner where, as it was to expect, her trove was much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the owner of <unk> <unk> for the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked for over the rest was that someone had ever reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer fireman -- I'm witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a logarithmic scale, but also of acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have made them, or are there to be -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this: Don't hang on.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a park in <unk>
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the chance to save the life of someone but every day we're going to influence someone's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete had been built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the <unk> unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
His name was called <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that it has been made of 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings, or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the computer block -- the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks -- stacked around each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the particular block -- the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together through magnets.
So you can't place the wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and you can really start to make larger circuits.
A blue with a green one makes light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a light light.
And we would take this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, you're actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or more slow, you just spin this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to be thrown into bricks and ready to use.
<unk> <unk> solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For instance, how does a light light, or why the door of an elevator is still open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience some electronics in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  ago, a few weeks ago, we took <unk> designers from Rhode Island to have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and we said, "Do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that is afraid of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the grasp of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interaction world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is to get involved with the focus on the focusing on the focus on the focusing on the focusing on the focusing on the focusing on the focusing on the approach.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
We can continue to do better we leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I will be the time for time?
Okay. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and work for a year to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> of Peace <unk>
I got a few members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of going to the Third World we send them into wildlife <unk>
They made big <unk> they worked with the employees of <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
So meet <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it shows up as if I was looking at a quote, but what really seeks is someone else -- when it stays caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it is covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get to help from this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, I was going to spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
And when you do that, you put a name, in this case you put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component here.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the <unk> government.
And it goes viral.
A responsible for systems in the city of <unk> to see this app realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to get <unk> <unk>
It's very important that function of the tsunami, but the people are stealing the batteries.
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean up sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that plan using using it.
And this has spread out without <unk> in a organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't happen yet.
<unk> acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they were done by the normal channels would have taken at least two and reduced two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the court of California that until the moment has cost 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that came up in a couple of days and it spreads in viral shape is a kind of throwing warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the government better ways to work, not as in private enterprises, as many people think should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in the form of open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to move together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They're not given to the government.
You feel a lot of frustration to that, but you don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we have lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings on politics, a row at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us nuts, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they were not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care of services and information.
It's the place which serves calls if you mark it in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
<unk> <unk> at the base of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open up the doors of the house, put music very hard and see if you were <unk>
And so well for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a web and a mobile, called <unk> <unk>
Don't get that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually came up with this <unk> <unk> in my trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home.
Good Night <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income that collaboration to distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I'm not necessarily talking about the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people will be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it might have been connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people understand it, but they think you're the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government to prescribe our values and it really belongs to our needs, but then we don't see what we see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the superficial layer of it.
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that holds us that we financed as something that is operating on our against, that other thing, and we are losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work on, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You have <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> of the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for the ones that have been <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we're going to get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't get out of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can be applied to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I think, <unk> I'm a larger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem they don't care about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They lay hands to work to program applications that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> dumping a trash garbage that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not just consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and <unk>
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling, you can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional young house of a African-American family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way it looked like the world.
She was hard but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at him, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I got so strong that I could barely breathe and then I got sick.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me, and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I was getting back again and if I said yes, I was allowed to peace.
I had this human quality of that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight to nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, he went through the room, he took me off the room, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't know it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know you've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do whatever you do?
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give me three things: I want you to do it.
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to tell you, is we always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to talk about is that you will always do the right thing -- although the right thing is <unk>
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want to focus on, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister one sister.
When I was 14 or 15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us and my sister and we went to the forest.
We just got to make the <unk> of all the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, she gave my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, I'm <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
I got the look at force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spread apart.
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I mean by the power he has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we have to, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities, you find so much <unk> so despair determined by these facts.
One in three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> of all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that comes up with a lot better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth which affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in the other states, <unk> yourself if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely <unk> the right to vote.
And if we put it over to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before it was before it was before you read the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without chance to come in.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death row.
This issue death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they have been <unk> to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die because of the <unk> crime, but if we deserve to kill them.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death is defined by mistake.
Out of nine Jewish people have identified one which is innocent that it's <unk> and liberated from the death row.
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
And on aviation it wouldn't allow you to fly in planes if every nine than <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill them.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery to you.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding of the reconstruction and the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are people who come up with me and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach at the people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
And all of the time <unk> each other.
We were constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't get rid of apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany at death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's very disturbing to you to listen to what you want.
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We can never have it here."
The room was silent, and a lady said, "There is no way that our history, we could ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we intentional and intentional and <unk> we were to <unk>
So let's talk about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation as Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their own <unk>
We could not get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things are the positive things they are, though, without the <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. Tell creativity.
We love entertainment.
But recently, those realities are bound by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both of those things.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our self.
We have to believe that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
And with innovation, with innovation, development is not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also for the heart of the heart.
This connection to mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in places and be <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is almost in the heart of what I believe, that even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no <unk> disconnect with technology and design, which allows us to truly be human if we don't pay attention to poverty, we don't pay attention to inequality, in the injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege as a young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, I was called the <unk> lady called me, to go, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I know I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks led to me and said, "Now, let me show you that this idea of justice <unk>
You know, what you're trying to do."
And I started to give you my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice management.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and I looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find ways to address those challenges, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, is not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not that it's a <unk>
And so I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> -- we don't really judge ourselves from our technology, because of our design or rational.
By the end of the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich and powerful people, but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do so much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> customers and 14 years, which have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what's not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night I was awake at God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, you must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 year-old customer a little poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> which said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer is treated as a <unk> father, CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I had been <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there's no ethical and a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not just <unk> it had been sent to court.
It took about two months, I had been forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the court of this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man who came up with a black man was the <unk> of the court.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I went up and approached me, and I was shocked.
And I was <unk> in the ear,
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That has deeply connected to me, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I got in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I did."
People started in. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written these crazy things.
They came up with the cops <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, I without knowing how, the room was full of people, but we're talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we are talking about inequality.
With the eye <unk> I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
And they would look down the window and let them hear all that <unk>
You walk around here and for there.
Finally, this old black black, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would take a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant at the <unk> he was shown <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black guy stood up, he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man to keep her view on the target with <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and our dignity.
Our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity should be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience to help in this community, to help in your purposes to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today in management <unk>
For instance, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death penalty in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of homicide cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds these funds to make the law, the law of security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge declining decline in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say that is this?
<unk> Actually, <unk> rate has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's by the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population comes in.
And we let ourselves convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people out of <unk> chain to rob a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> You've been excited about it today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six days.
The idea is that media media would prefer <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to it.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses -- our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop in all of this data is an ancient clip of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us.
That's why a <unk> of stories will look at the negative.
That old adage saying, "If you have blood, you are very true.
And given that all digital devices give us negative news the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not surprising to be <unk>
It doesn't surprise you that people think the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues -- climate change, the species of species -- water shortage, water and <unk> we have no doubts them.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long of the time, we've just got them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We are really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we keep doing very much more and higher decisions.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water toilets, <unk> <unk> air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So much of this is technology and, recently, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we can put into information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law is a <unk> price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, at war and peace, in depression and on the rise.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> of Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
And computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> they call infinite computing computing, sensors and networks, the 3D printing and distribute output and personalized production across the planet, the synthetic biology, fuels fuel vaccines and food, digital medicine and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, from <unk>
It was <unk>
I <unk> in the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create life <unk> for each <unk> it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that thing that is scarce and making it happen.
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> story in the <unk>
He's the kind of the left.
They had dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops had covered with silver, and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> Washington is aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about need, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT looked at a study that shows that in the late end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents in national average.
And if we have plenty of energy, we also have water abundance as well.
So let's talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed on.
<unk> a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A pale <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, and the two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a refrigerator size.
It is able to generate 1,000 liters of drinking water by any day of any source -- saltwater, water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just been concerned that will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that this is going to be, Coca-Cola is to implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an integral innovation by this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars a video of video <unk> video images, images of books and music, technology <unk> now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to you when you have the health applications for you.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to get these technologies into a mobile device with the way that they talk, and because they have <unk> they can get blood of the finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are doctors, where the payload <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this <unk> device -- a RNA virus -- or DNA that I don't want to call the <unk> of health and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just passed the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection of human explosion is to give to the world of education and health care.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, switching from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before the world is to add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What <unk> What kind of <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we deliver 3,000 billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and being able to act for the first time?
What did you do? These three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X <unk> is that small equipment led by their passion with a clear goal, and they can do things that were just going to do things that could only do great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really struck me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this with this university professors and each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the recognition machinery of human patterns is better than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few decades in front of a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I will just give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that I was <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually pick up fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was caught up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, over the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept:
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned too much with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
I had <unk> from about 20 inch, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had declined in half.
I went to five centimeters.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of Southern Asia.
In the 1970s, I probably started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat.
I went out to fish on him, and we did studies in the southern Sea Sea <unk> and, above all, in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured was <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was and other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny things on a few remains of a coral reef that are fish from coral.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you take a study and then start the commercial fishing begins.
The background is about being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to take me out, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains, is what the fishermen are collected every time you go to an area where they've never fish.
But there was no <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
Let's start the starting point to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you go to it, this happens something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, biodiversity, <unk> <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and we extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
They don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end, keeping some <unk> remains.
And that, in large extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer they are, or they're not what they did.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very abundant before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a big sea of large fish.
They become unlikely because they <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence was presented in a previous way isn't the way they would expect to have the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of us have to have to like to give a captain and just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used -- or usually they don't use the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Hence the huge role that can be turned into the protected <unk>
Because with the marine areas, we really recreated the past.
And you know, the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run up and extremely low.
That's for the people you can see a protected protected zone, and they can benefit from the vision that lets them erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people from the <unk> for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema maybe can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there was gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about it, if you think about what people were used with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do you deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one to give, is "Please make <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I am Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So we're going to see what we're going to see why videos are made viral and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today the online video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can become famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of this is a lot of a percentage of the views and the cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and the surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of popular summer last summer.
<unk> was not supposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had posted a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> posted this <unk> to <unk> the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> presented to us things and interesting and interesting things to do it to a larger public audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to get a weekend --  -- everybody wants to come up in the end of a week, the weekend.       KA: He won't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science Science was one of the first people to do a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a <unk> group of trends will embrace a point of view and share it with an audience -- accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every one of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation, by doing this with a piece of music.
That's all about it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's rare, you know that there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did one version of the old one.
And then international <unk>
All of a sudden, a whole community came out of a community that did this happen to be a silly joke to something that we all can form a <unk>
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or Black <unk>
What script could you have written to be written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up two days of video -- just that really unique and unexpected thing can be able to be able to get these things out of the way that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> in New York, I'm going to admit that I didn't get interested too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that keep you properly embarrassed by <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise effect and your humor, Casey <unk> made it to five million you saw and understand your idea.
So this is why this approach is worth doing all the new way we do in creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> in creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of culture, of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't give permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only one of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so long, friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died of the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to get it, but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn of <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a marriage man, and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task -- the escape from his family and a new in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> which challenges the fiction, a boat was sent to the warm sea of a regular ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear of the gods, the rape and the death.
As most of the adults -- my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were excited to first take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving in every wave, and the horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to break for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and finish the journey was too much to it, and the first apple that I did, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants from Mars.
Unlike the middle of the middle class that I <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car line of cars, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title for <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and <unk> an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what was supposed to be, which was generally <unk> clothes that was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle school, one to hide the holes on the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I went to the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were excited about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be <unk>
She opened a computer store and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry <unk> and <unk> and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They were looking for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in dark worlds.
In one, it was the classical student -- <unk> with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in life, tragically <unk> by violence, abuse of drug and isolation.
But many of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer they picked me the Australian girl in the year.
And I went <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges are not <unk>
<unk> <unk> resident in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee activist and invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses that she had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> over the day of every one and running <unk> three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when she got into the ship.
The "no" ever had ever been an option.
<unk> told me, and you don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking about, the more I was getting to talk about.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of the way.
And although I finished my work, I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a new exercise -- and not just it's good, but it's something that you're grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not in the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism -- a nice mix of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people for those who the motto can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year, we had no <unk>
At the end of each day, I was making a giant array of soup that all <unk>
They went to good entry at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we opened it out.
It made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before you finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered to it.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up.
At 17 became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without your husband, it caused a <unk> to <unk> and bringing it itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't be <unk>
I was in the shower in the <unk> hotel room when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw me standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell you stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked her to <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us were and how life <unk> us, we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy thing to the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, and you have brave in each wave, the <unk> pace of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them safe I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here, in the fourth or fifth line.
My story starts in <unk> a couple of years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians we wanted to travel to a car and they would save the sky.
Now we do it with airplane.
So in that time when I first came out, the big prince Greek was <unk> he pulled out a bow and a <unk> to the ground, she could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we pulled was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very excited to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give me this idea of losing the ability to lose and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't shake my friends.
It seemed like technology had to allow the magic to kill her.
My grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technology was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the sense that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent the cameras out of it.
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I came up with this kind of technological world to see how it would use it to create magic, instead of killing her.
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative that can connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where are we going.
And they put the text together with the image, animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do with that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
It says, "Take your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
And in many moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl inside all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that were <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always <unk>
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, they light up your way into the <unk>
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I <unk> towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it is also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect of me is to create Indian content and the particular time.
These are the <unk>
We all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> counterparts in the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and moist book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that comes current issues like the environmental crisis.
And by talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and then collect pictures of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual from childhood you need to go out and in a chapter, you would take a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then can be put on the Web.
A little boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within variations between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have to have a interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through <unk> and you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology to come to each other.
We sell the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of all, or maybe not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> caused us to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
He's got a <unk> on and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time in which I need support, or any urgency of that style but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week will be available for the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are taking them from their houses, to take their blood pressure, they bring their doctor, and share them with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to control and be captains of their own <unk> but we can also help health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention -- the demand for demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share it with you with a video.
We all have checks from navigation in <unk>
Maybe we have in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves life in this moment.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody who is <unk> they can use their iPhone, and then the next few weeks to use their cellphone from Microsoft to find the closest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we want to change the global level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody -- can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I would also want to invite companies around the world that could help us to validate these <unk>
You might be <unk> or <unk> or <unk> people, for instance, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in place.
Please <unk> in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a little bit different because when you use the camera the camera was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me the photograph had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
I felt like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when press <unk>
<unk> like this: a <unk> <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some kind of photography.
<unk> where you have to think a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what's the trick that makes you real <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
Did you get the light?
What is it creating <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and you put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it's combined in some ways you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain, because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually in combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic as I think are those in which I don't even forget about the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But when I combine photographs it's very important to be <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to follow in order to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with perfect staff.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of pictures of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even took the house of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
It always starts with an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that the result can be very beautiful, and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide of technology, very boring technology.
Please if you can <unk>
This is a diagram anybody who took out of a portfolio of it.
I'm not interested in the way that I'm going to show you the details but the overall way.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of perpetual microprocessors versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one as many other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
This is something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why would we build technological curves on <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to do -- the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it turns out a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation <unk> as fast as it was last morning we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go into that rhythm.
There are no unprecedented history in the history of technological growth that every few years of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves. We see that they don't keep forever.
You can't sustain this change as fast as it goes.
And we got one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be in a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way embraces the world?
Why new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going to be <unk>
We can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different that we extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long term.
The scale of time that I'd like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we looked at each billion years.
So we go back to a few two billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with lots of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If you look at the way that we organized those chemicals -- we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, he had floating down with some oil oil with all kinds of chemical recipes in its inner inside.
Some of those blobs of oil drops a particular combination of chemicals that made them the materials out of the outside and the blobs grew together.
And they began to divide.
In a sense, those were the most prolific cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow are <unk> being better at the time of bringing up chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
I usually lived over time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life -- very simple chemistry, but things become interesting about when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this technological evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same system of writing.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people's security people.
But <unk> Tom <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card I have a lot of for all of them -- in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years old.
But then another big step occurred in which things were very different in which things got very different and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, the resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
In that way, <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came so much that, in fact, they come together and decided to write all the recipe from the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities that have community communities, communities of many different types of cells working together like a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not good without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, or the brain.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
These started collecting information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these mobile phones are <unk>
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and to convey the information.
Those are the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as a <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So a could, for example, would learn to have a certain organism because I knew evil and sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had before they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of the fruit that they ate out there.
So the fact that the nervous system built these <unk> information structures that the evolutionary process built.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the communication trick.
So for example, the most controversial version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in his heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated to make it sound into sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
We now move through similar periods to organisms that are <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
And you saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales over time again.
The first stages of history that I told you took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The beyond, and the language, they took less than a million years.
And over there, like electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we looked at in this curve explosion.
We can see that the process was <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent humanity.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to heal myself in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor transistor is done on that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> designers we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that makes something that I didn't do, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put within the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these random sequences at random, running all those programs, and take those of those who get more excited about what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more approaching us numbers.
Of course, a few random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now we <unk> the <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who would provide <unk> and that the children will make the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's get back again.
I put some mutations together.
And it tries to do it again and try with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in such a complicated, very few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that have absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're dark programs, <unk>
But they get <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the security because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> which work together to offer a <unk> flight doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so they can run these programs much faster.
So it is <unk>
The thing goes more and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what is going to come.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I got sick.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up some of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat my talk, I talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who tries to be <unk> to the first base -- not come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, this is someone that 10 car <unk> hit four.
<unk> like <unk> Ted Williams, the last player in the <unk> League of <unk> to run more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now I will take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon who has a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a distant place and a wanted to have two coronary arteries, <unk> and your family physician <unk> a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know something?
She's getting very much better.
And their hits has been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'm going to ask you.
What do you think of should be the average hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sent to the world, and I would say, with the mandate of being perfect.
I'd never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs to a <unk>
Fair enough.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the General <unk> Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the fork of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent differential diagnostic and not standard.
And I even knew the differential diagnostic about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And I read from the school school with the impression that if you did everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I'm going to get away from the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency service where I was working.
At the time, I was assigned to <unk>
And when emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist I would go to that patient.
and reporting to the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a sound sound on both sides, what was sent to me, a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart is going to work and instead of moving the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, and these are infected with blood, and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started to work on the treatment that I read him.
I gave aspirin and medication to relieve the pressure on your heart.
I gave him a little bit of water pills so that I could get a liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
I sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't raise the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him so that the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to bring some information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to <unk> constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I first send it home, I didn't notice a voice on my inner voice that would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so insecure that even I asked the nurse that I would give to the lady <unk> "Do you believe that it's okay if you go <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think I will be good."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed the high and the ambulance along with the <unk> he took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach,
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that point, I did something I don't do normally, I do something I don't do normally, I do something.
It was the emergency service service home.
And there is another nurse, not the <unk> lady before, but another person said to me, and he said three words, those three words that most emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: Does it remember you?
"He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "You know, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
By one time to have arrived at his house, after I gave the high school, he suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> they brought them to emergency room with a breast blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock of severe.
Just breathing and I was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
They had an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and he was waiting for all of the hope that he was going to be.
And in the two or three days, it was obvious that I never <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, she left her to go. He was <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time -- shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, <unk> without feeling that shame is healthy because you can't stand with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that lets a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is the one that makes us feel bad in the inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was that that we did was bad, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take things out, and I made sure that I didn't care about.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I tell my <unk> Why was he sent to her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why I chose medicine?
Little at that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in one day it was opened up the sky and finally went off the sky and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself where if we were doing the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, I would take away from those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It's going to happen.
Two years later, I was an entrepreneur, in the emergency room in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 to a pain in the throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little <unk>
He took penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he ran to the door kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> <unk> my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: Does it remember you?
Do you remember the patient in the <unk>
And he came back and he didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a condition that was potentially deadly called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, didn't die.
You know, <unk> antibiotics goes down to a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because you would have 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation
It turned out an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out normal.
The other patient was very much diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I checked it out, and when you notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was passionate about it, <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get it up, and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> my wrong leg, believe it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that do not sleep, and the ones that I don't know, the ones who have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you try to care about medicine to people who make mistakes, we're going to be a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and computer journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical training, and I've done a personal study for learning how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto, "Star to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one of the 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are wrong, or the <unk> is not correct. In a system where the hospital-acquired infections, are increasingly, and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, oil <unk> were dying by <unk> medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes up with <unk> eyes, and with breath of alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They don't neglect their symptoms always in the same way.
So mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all of the professionals likely to error, well, you wouldn't stay anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white <unk> white art is already a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> -- this is my worst <unk> blah, blah blah blah blah blah  "What are your <unk> <unk> <unk>
And their students are <unk> <unk> <unk> their head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
We can say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, you know it, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but they try to learn from what happened to teach others.
They took their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving way to support all of them <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans are running the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I did a survey over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says to pick up an American American -- it's about 70 to day.
Not a long time ago, in a research for a group of companies from business.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that we would run by these executives and the time that we would expect to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work has a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or so.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of its time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many of the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How is it the way that drives those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choosing to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and of some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard mustard and <unk> more than 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and 25 water <unk> and this was when they made water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop but on one occasion, I asked myself, why I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf from oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
Once I decided to go to the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He gives me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with his cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
You go.
They had different kinds of different classes.
They put a post that they put on the entrance to the shop.
We put there out there from six <unk> or 24 flavors different and looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop trying to stop testing it.
More people stopped when I had just <unk> a <unk> that when I had only six 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when I had <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
What stood up when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, decide we don't buy <unk> it's probably good for us to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices are affecting us in good <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when we don't care about.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funds are available to savings plans.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had plans that were going from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there was less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation came to the 50th 60s.
It turns out even if you decide when you decide when there's more options, even in that case, there are unintended consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of choice, more people are <unk> to avoid the actions or the hedge funds.
As soon as more options, they were more willing to invest in market bank accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we need to optimize to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that <unk> the decision, that <unk> even when this is going against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less likely to pick things down, even though they objectively them better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to compare to contrast and choose from that awesome <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which has never been more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're seeing increasingly is that if you decide to be able to cut, get rid of weird options, you will have a increase in sales, you will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> 15, you saw 10 percent <unk>
When the Golden Rule <unk> eliminated the products to waste out of cats that are less <unk> increased the <unk> in <unk> by two largest sales and lower cost.
You know that today's supermarkets on average offers 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, there's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have come up about how to handle the best options is that David <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of the employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a security fund.
The people who really want to choose, they offer 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know how often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All options are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they can't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation with all paid the world's most beautiful highway.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something more.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first <unk> than the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were made to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why does people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when you use credit card cards or credit cards that when you use it yet.
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out that you have to be seen more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that reunion, that we had a lot like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we encouraged the staff to think about the positive things that they would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place in their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a conference room.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> throughout the <unk> corridor of journals can contain from <unk> different kinds of different <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> exhibitions here.
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
Well, more.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This <unk> framework is completely useless.
Students must tell you something that we <unk> not to the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
And she would be, who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than we think about if you just shake it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision <unk> buying a car.
This is a car manufacturer that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each other.
<unk> <unk> <unk> I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box of <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which the decisions.
So the middle of customers are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, a few examples, four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four boxes, 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to do?"
How involved you are.
If you will, the default button in every single decision, this is that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from lots of choices to few weeks, we would take the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they keep up there.
The same information, same information, same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which information is presented.
If we start with how easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we choose the box of changes to not say anything about the preferences of <unk> in all ways we are <unk> to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more engaged with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of disaster overload -- to be able to eliminate alternate alternatives -- to do it, and we can use it -- we can manage more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are working.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more they are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the East East, if you had a typewriter to write it had to be <unk> to the government.
I had to record a sheet of text from example written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of <unk>
If they found a script with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much that is that we would have freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer in any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some little printed yellow dots on every page that follow a pattern that makes you one and your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be a lot of fun for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world we can set together the attacks on their <unk>
Three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of them.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, which is Matthew <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online but they do it by illegal media by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought into a computer computer.
The secret secret service of the United States, two months ago, <unk> the <unk> of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say today is more likely that any of us are being victim of a genuine crime than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most crimes are happening online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, the protests, they motivate them to motivate you, laughs you.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> over the last 12 months, occupying a major role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who make it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group is the national the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority out of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
They put the safety of the site and put together a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if you were to <unk> the death of people because of the attack for <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die from one attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we would have a foreign authority in foreign authority.
And they were emitting <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters -- the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale of the communications citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide them tools for governments to do this to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to research their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it goes beyond this today.
It was <unk> Internet connection.
We have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, whatever the right thing we will expect, will be forever.
<unk> yourself in any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have been worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have <unk> in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, as the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our won.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we got in the morning and we found it dead in the morning, and we found myself very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and the whole land for <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
People were dying in warriors who protect our community and livestock -- and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were giving them scary.
But I realized that this really doesn't really understand, because even I was helping lions to see the pen away.
I don't have <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions so that they believed it was near the <unk>
But the lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and the second day, and they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So she jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come out.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which you turn into and turn the lights.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery load the electricity into the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights out.
As you can see, the <unk> go outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights go down, and they throw them into lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You see them. You can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, for frightening to other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants from farms.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach you how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see planes and I used to see flying airplanes and told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come into airplane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close to an electric <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know that <unk> <unk> but I want to make mine.
CA: So I did it once, right now, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stood up because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> <unk> Richard <unk> You're a big thing.
We're going to focus on every step that I took friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the <unk> story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought that I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed in <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
I said, "When you <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in two weeks of past.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so holes, we're ready to die."
It was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in her arms looking at her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine led to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived grass, insects and <unk>
It also became more and more prevalent the energy <unk> all of my way around me was completely dark at night except by the world's lights in China, just across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the developing countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life is like <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because American refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare became arrested when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was standing on the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the day, an officer said to another, "This was a false report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for <unk> in <unk> <unk>
But many can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> had been eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless countries are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape a lot of other North America hasn't been so lucky.
It's tragedy that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to take you on to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South them.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I?
At a sudden, there was no country I could call my pride with a pride of pride,
Although I went to the life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities were making some money that sent my family, and as blame my family was going to be displaced to the force to a distant location in the <unk>
They had to run away from it immediately.
I began to plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it out somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and he tackled an American police officer.
And he asked all of us of all, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese official came up to my family, I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but I always believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated across the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most low dots in my life.
I did everything for releasing my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the South Korea.
I was going to go between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a young man, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind asking to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Korean and <unk>
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why would you <unk>
"I am not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to get it to the <unk>
And I showed myself that the goodness of strangers and international community support are really the rays of hope that the people are <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they put a new country, they start with little or nothing of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us keep in contact with families still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food <unk>
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Central <unk> to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles and South Angeles as if this is what it's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles   <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans, in a desert desert -- Los Angeles Center home to the home <unk> to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to get kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying of diseases in Los Angeles Center, in Los York.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was glad to see this happening.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come home -- you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold as <unk> cars.
I see centers centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of managing 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have any pesticides.
What I did, that was planting a food forest in front of my home.
In a Gaza <unk> we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, and I, in Green L.A. we get together and we started planting our food forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine vegetables do.
What we do, we are kind of a <unk> group of <unk> made by gardeners of all the <unk> all over the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then somebody <unk>
The city went on to me, and in summary I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I was like, "Come on, right?
It was a court order to plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the history written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million plant plants.
Why the hell don't you look like this?
<unk> a plant, a <unk> 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of outcome.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Africa.
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I was excited to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew my art.
Like an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, land like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you leave your canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how does it affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became an education tool, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You would stop seeing how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most compelling act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, which came a mother and her daughter, were like <unk> at night, and they were in my yard, and they were in my backyard, and they were looking very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't tell me that people go to rob your <unk>
So I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to go away."
That's not in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the same time, I want you to hold your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter to put it in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant their mom and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how it changed, so just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come, work and <unk> all on a volunteer.
If the kids grow <unk> the boys will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they will eat <unk>  But if none of them are told, if they don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, eat blind things that you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they are caught. I see some color kids that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who were complaining about their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about for free, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put the kids out of the street, to know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Would you take them to take their <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to come up with me, you know, I'm not calling me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very <unk> road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains, a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water on asphalt than <unk>
And especially if you're going on on your bike, and these cars go -- that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material that if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a <unk>
The solution to that is to make roads for asphalt roads <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the Netherlands, has <unk> <unk> and water can go through it, so all of the rain water flow into the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't have any water <unk>
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all of the noise will go, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road road the stones on the surface of it.
First one stone, then several more and more and more, and then on, and then -- well, I won't do that.  But they can harm their <unk> and they're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So you can actually see how the damage is in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so you only have a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if you were <unk> you're going to be <unk> and you get out of the <unk>
So if they drive the road, they roll the <unk> like we saw it here.
So to solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel <unk> into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool into it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is they heat steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are linked back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine from <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample right now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made a lot of samples, we put a lot of payload on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and we did it and we came back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> -- to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface -- actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, you have curiosity if this also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It's actually got to cool first before I can show you how the country acts like this.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC by News on his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually about it.
"The Taliban was <unk> she screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were complaining about Afghanistan and made the girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to serve my older sister who could no longer be able to be out to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could get the two to the two of them.
Every day, we were taking a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in the market so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, the school was a few suddenly a week, because the Taliban would go away.
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you were <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan -- in which her daughter, my mother, out to the school and so his father would get it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk to educate your children.
For the years of <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated with our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can choose to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want not to do it."
Today I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than <unk> and if my family hadn't been as committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find proud of graduate to <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the <unk> who was <unk> from his home by the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my university degree, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who took him on the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
It's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with a strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like the guys, <unk> for them, despite the time and even in front of a violent opposition there.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you're the phone, a voice had a <unk> that if I was following his daughter at school, you'd get it to try.
<unk> already, if you <unk> he said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for your old <unk>
What I've realized, and it's something which is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who have <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been the key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told, remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I'm afraid these changes are not going to make a lot, after the retirement U.S. U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that I would ask for them, that the <unk> I see a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls in <unk> would give me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died at the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never come back to a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution as well as the <unk> revolution.
One forces with many other citizen citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, <unk> <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> bravery in the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and about losses from about 50,000 <unk> we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with many other women, rebuild the civil society, <unk> a grassroots transition and just to democracy democracy and national reconciliation,
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- women in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> social leaders, so to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of women and for our right to share it in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> a environment that was increasingly <unk> than <unk> of the selfish policy of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was real-time and successful.
The women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we saw news from violence.
One day I woke up with the news of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the U.S. ambassador and the attack for <unk>
Another day aroused the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their knee, the human rights violations.
Our society, made out of a revolutionary mindset -- and it's been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
The <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all of us today to talk to our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and choices.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, chose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and safety to Libya.
The <unk> <unk> and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why our society is still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men as for women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation of consensus more than the election that we needed to do choices, which is just the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the gender depiction of the female more than you need to be <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting it into practice <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideal the ideal that a Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to be in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between the female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way before we do it in a <unk> fashion.
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God's <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which embraces all of the humanity that men and women, from which all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And like the uterus -- just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion all the existence.
This is what he is like, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
This is what it is, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That they are all about the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a compelling question, which has an answer as <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to tackle is that everybody makes the usual man, why she is left?
Why would someone be going to stay with a man who got him <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, not a social worker, no skilled in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had had a <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green American <unk> and I had a very big secret one.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, I would take my head into a <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, as I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> it more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It might even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all religions, all religions, all of the religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse -- only happens in mechanical relationships -- <unk> and <unk> or said otherwise, in the families, the last place we want or expect to find <unk> reason why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stand with a man who would stand with a man who would sit with a man who got it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States in the United States and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands -- in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was he also had a <unk> university of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most impressed by that first encounter was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field in the field.
He had some big <unk> as apples, and a wheat <unk> and a wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started to go out and loved all of <unk> who was so list, I had gone to Harvard, who put passion in helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it before.
And it was why the bachelor's of the <unk> and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important to him.
I didn't know the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York City and leave my work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I was left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering head in a financial trap financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site is supposed to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept it underneath the pillow on our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause their trauma to live.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was really serious for every minute of every day.
The first physicist <unk> was five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises from my neck had <unk> I put my mother's suit. He was married with him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily in forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> for the wedding and made a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent twice as much on our moon.
And the first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I had a few times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back on our moon of honey, went through the traffic and threw my Mac <unk> to the face.
He went on to <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or harassment at some point of their life, and the Disease Control Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question everyone else is doing is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why did I not help me. I could have gone anywhere.
So for me this is the most sad and painful question that people do -- because we were victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
Over 70 percent of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally been able to end the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent default, even after the <unk> has gone back to married, we would get out of financial resources, and it manipulation of the family judicial system for <unk> to the victim and his children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> his mother.
And yet we keep asking why they're just not going?
I was able to go away, because of one last <unk> up that beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone -- to the police, to the police, my neighbors, and my friends and family, full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to prescribe the victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people it's a way to say "The guilt is <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a committed lesson of what happened to them and to sell their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a heart of domestic violence very typical of domestic violence.
I became marrying a young man and nice and got those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, is a <unk> gun pointing to my head in someone who says he wants.
Right now, as you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> how stupid <unk> but all this time I've been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people that are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, to her sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my <unk> particularly breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
We are victims need all over the world.
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the abuse of light talking about it with their children, their colleagues at work, their friends and family.
They put their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down a climb and show the victims a safe way.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of secure and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel like at this moment, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have got it like this.  luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but to find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very much less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to spend this sweater on your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was completely uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would raise my back and I <unk> the hair of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago, for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our respect, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I'm on this stage.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white woman, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do it, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to an model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> also the associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold on. So they are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all of them and each one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they weren't white at all.
The next question people always ask me is: Can it be a model when we <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then what I would really tell each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, since you were the first.
If after this list, it was still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or <unk> CEO or next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model to say you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's outside your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike the <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get your studies, and you have a resume and some jobs on your backs, no matter what you want, you want to say, if you want to be president of the United States, but your owner would be <unk> inside 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're entering personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party for a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're a little bit of a professional group of professional professionals, and <unk> and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question people always ask me is, do things for free?
I have too many two-inch heel. I have never use, except the pair of previous ones, but the privileges I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and I was given for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a light light and of course, and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a Sorry, agent to be able to keep going.
<unk> from these privileges <unk> for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for their aspect of whatever they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, of the teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It was about how many times I think, and I would get it.
When I investigate this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure out to 78 percent to 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is, how is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe so forth.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative, ingenious and <unk> people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the brighter hair will be happier.
They only have to meet with a set of models, because they have the <unk> legs the brightest hair and the brightest hair, but probably be the <unk> women on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that will retain from this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception of the image that we have the success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I wasn't me who <unk> them.
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum part of the lighting.
In fact, most of them take random tourists at random.
My story begins by now, <unk> in New York City, to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and 5.
I happened to come back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what's coming now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you get to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you follow the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown unknown is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever touched the camera.
So we were not aware of how much it would change life this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This photo is from a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what I had happened that day as a three-year-old girl would understand.
These pictures are much more than more than a concrete moment or a specific trip.
They're also a way to stop in a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden she was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the toy shop that <unk> small in early <unk>
And he described to me what was meaning to the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remember his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things that we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you to all come up in the picture, and I didn't stand up to someone and asked him is a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most desolate <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs -- as characters were stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, you and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with the <unk> Parliament but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't hold clean the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who found mainly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the World <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they going to be <unk> First of all, provide life ecological services <unk>
They're our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria they help to absorb the anthrax that not be because they would stretch and cause great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the sentence and under Egypt.
In the mythology Hindu <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the devil of 10 heads <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they are very important <unk> to open sky, in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, and so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are on extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey out of their livestock consumption, which has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India and you've taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time bomb, and the number of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this for birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trading trade in the dead to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so that I focus on a locally locally not going to do anything.
We have to work with governments at the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise, you can write a letter to their government and tell them to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you would tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with your children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed of opinion because he saw it flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do -- and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm no longer I am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa of <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we would do, the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we got with seeds by the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that goes down to the river <unk> and we teach the locals growing tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not in all interested in doing that, so they were excited to come to work, and sometimes they weren't going to be <unk>  We were very much in the local <unk> in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> time to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is grown <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> In Italy, a tomato tomato in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and eat everything.  And we said, <unk> my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never going to be <unk>
I thought that was only the Italians -- we were making mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they did -- what they were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
We would see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that that money has been <unk>
They just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the harm we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my children, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "You know, the small one is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to give the 27 years only to answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever have <unk> but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people, the <unk> of the local dream to become a better person.
So what does you? Do you do?"
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not not, for once, but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they're never going to be told in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what have they <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't do their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the business doctor of the business, the business physician sets up with you in your house, on the coffee, and that helps it find the resources to transform your passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects online, and the government came to me to see the question: "How can you do that?
How can you do that? And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I got <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 business businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in the history passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before getting involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you for you, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you would come out in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you think about this morning <unk>
<unk> local people -- that's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossils and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year I was assembled this group of people. And <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is held up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses, would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States were <unk> <unk> generic companies <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them <unk>
In the other way, they won't come up with you.
Then, you have to offer you absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then then you have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing and you have to have to have a terrific financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was not born.
We have investigated and looked at the 100 companies in the industrialized world, <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have common -- only one: no one was started by one person.
No word like, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment, in bars in bars along bars along bars with <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman is talking about this <unk> someone who speaks to you, what needs it?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, you can see it. You can see the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Tell <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People who are around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change much knowledge despite the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understanding our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and dream?
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with giant <unk> which give shadow <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives music to music.  There's a screen in New <unk>   The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most beautiful number of <unk> properties.
I live near this house, and I thought I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
He was suddenly a sudden and was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this brings me a profound gratitude for the living and the lived time.
He brought it to the significant things about my current life.
But I want to be able to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch on day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this home house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before they die I want to be judged by <unk>  "Before they die I want to sit on the line of <unk> change.
Before I die of dying I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before they died, I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die. I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I die of dying I want to make you once more."
"Before I die. I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
"Before I die. I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and dreams and hopes of people asked me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what's most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues at the civic school we did a kit and now they have been walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share one another.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distraction that is more important than ever before, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and delicate lives.
Age is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that prepare for death is one of those things that makes us more power.
You think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hopes, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old and very hot.
Not speak, but it makes joy better than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love is.
It's <unk> it happens what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and notice in this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I didn't even see -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that has to be the unknown.
Samuel 16 years old is high. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you'd pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normality, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they wouldn't consider it, it could only one thing: they were <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, and it is that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that quickly increases in the world, there is no cause or any known.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't look very interested in me at all.
<unk> living and <unk> in his own world, with its own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting car cars around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating whatever <unk>
As I grew up, it would come back more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> had something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature a child that looked at the world without to <unk> a human being that had never implemented.
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, times I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
Quite the beauty of the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different vision of what is right.
If I could put it one single thing to <unk> and Sam and you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift in your interior and, frankly, the search for normality, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change dies at the moment when we try to be like others.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what has been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a teacher of communications, who would give a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and his big books and his big words and unknown words.
But when I developed those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell down the rabbit hole and saw the door in a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students. They were surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care -- and if we don't know how we understand this, the job is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to ensure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
Now, why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try to deal with it.
And when you're describing your science, care about <unk>
The <unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them dumb things.
On the contrary, as Einstein, is everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise with ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they are ways of turned and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked, why are you called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> <unk> kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's actually supported by the area of the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a very simple line, which is that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can provide graphics that we would embrace our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it was <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge of it, no matter -- platform or <unk> and when you win, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One of the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, that the British Parliament.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
He was thrown in the <unk> Tower and <unk> but he had the courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's a question.
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call a <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
All kinds of suggestions you could have had <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> of State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it -- they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate would be <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I always <unk> it with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be translated from power.
They didn't want to call him King if he didn't give him to his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give it the more <unk> title and the most unfortunate title that they had been happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was already before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and sign up with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take it seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama is kind of going to go there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important, and I want to show you -- is that the President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has endowed with <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do to you <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, actually change a lot more the words than they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under a land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear the voices that talk about, but mostly that cacophony of <unk> male and rocks <unk> with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap flashlight of light -- they belong to this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that they hold the walls of that <unk> hole that drops hundreds of feet on Earth.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met before before, who lost control and dropped a mile on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole, risk their lives without paying a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they may never do it because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> a NGO that dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not in the grade.
When we ended up talking to me very sad, I was honestly <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> my stomach and weeks later, I flew L.A. to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them, even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans moved across the entire slave slaves in the entire transatlantic slave age.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> of <unk> today.
And yet, today you can be enslaving entire families by generations per year from 18 dollars.
<unk> slavery generates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with fake promises of good education and better work to find that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operating in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves are value, but those of them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everyone and yet illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show of this strange show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> of <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> by the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
I had no coffee eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> made it pee was pretty <unk>
So <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera was too warm to the touch, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to him, and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
And back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do you here."
And it explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizenship of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his release and she trusted the <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying stones for miles per <unk> <unk> to trucks they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than kids who get the shoes and the children would put them into their heads with straps <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with what they <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they had <unk>
By hearing the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
It took me up a few stairs <unk> who gave this <unk> basement light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in the craft, they're local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where they were <unk> them with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced to <unk> customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse with their hands of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of a <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs so it <unk>
There was no doors there.
There was no windows enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a topic that hard, it's important to point out that slavery even human trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in the agriculture, in restaurants, in the home service and the list can continue.
So recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children sell every year as sex as sex as well.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families going on into the trade of <unk>
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and the <unk> of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope to be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where our job."
It is estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the <unk> <unk> the greatest <unk>
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older kids, some younger kids, and it makes sense of it.
<unk> were all <unk>
The children are separated from their <unk> families -- missing and forced to work on these boats on these boats in the lake, even though they don't know swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> I think his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The <unk> branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often <unk> networks and children, <unk> and fear, is thrown into water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to flee and as all of life has been treated with <unk> <unk> he tries to slaves younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they woke up the last networks, but they had been working from the one one.
<unk> and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes is the possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
They went on a road in Ghana with <unk> partners, the <unk> a partner <unk> with his bike. he suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to take it through a road road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started to <unk> we removed the <unk> that we put on the road and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures about my head as I put it into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> the road ended up in the one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children bound to their back, and they were looking for gold, <unk> in charge water, with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in a well part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people carry all of these people carry <unk> and then they will be transported to another area where they <unk> the <unk> to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong and strong men and <unk> but if we look closer at the side, we see working at other fewer fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up as this victim of T.B. and <unk> by mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
When she died his uncle, she <unk> the debt of the uncle -- what force to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, I worked in the <unk> 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, but that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream about being liberated and educated with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, from face to a remote possibility -- that inspires me a lot respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know your images would be seen by you all around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to give testimony to them and to make everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see ourselves as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not of magazines. They are people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I would happen that I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope that these images wake up a force in which you can see them in people like you, and I hope that <unk> turn on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do some applied math and there's a particular problem for the <unk> we are as the management engineers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>   that we will see later on.
But the classic demands an extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a virtuous pollen promise.
Over the last few years has been made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness of <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't use the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could get the exam to get these ourselves?
I don't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do, as a way not conventional to a try, you can see, in a certain sense, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> ropes.
It shows someone healthy as the sounds of a <unk> <unk> we can imagine as a dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have a need to need the <unk> for example.
And as <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Think of the time that leads to a child learning how to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as they <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
<unk> you can see an example of irregular <unk> of <unk> ropes.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not <unk> They're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but in addition to the exams they're not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as much as a lot.
It's very low cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears at mass scale.
These are some amazing targets to <unk>
We can reduce the patients <unk>
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for pregnancy for routine.
And hopefully we could have goals goals.
We could make a low-cost mass <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving you today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative of Parkinson's disease.
Together and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local local lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without disease, it can call low price and leave recordings for a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people -- you can say who's healthy and who not?
What are coming from these <unk>
<unk>
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different times, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors for the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have an accuracy <unk> right now.
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network too, which is what the project. Now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: Let's go down and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are perfectly gray.
We were focusing on the dark, underground rooms and large, we avoid the sunlight.
We do the <unk> models even more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect -- we do the impossible and focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Soon time later, an organization that was <unk> there were <unk> there -- was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we learned that we couldn't stay on the house, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen town in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in land.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
It would take rubble from channels and <unk>
And we took off schools, we took the mud and leave the lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and cards.
Everybody did the same.
They took them to take them and take them to different places of the peoples around the world to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As he <unk> of the wave, and to save his lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean up the <unk> <unk> huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center took the photos.
And they took them and had the honor that that day I was <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't even going through my horizons that something happened.
When I look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, a few people were still in the lab in the lab, how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started putting the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get to do a lot of precision and <unk>
In other ways, that little girl would have no aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got a little bit more pictures and they needed more <unk> and so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> a town neighbor to Northern <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the time Olympic libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depends on the <unk> of the photos.
I could have an hour. I could have a <unk>
I could have a <unk>
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the <unk> areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures long -- in seawater -- covered in bacteria, with seaweed, even there with seaweed, all of it along with the step of time, I continue to get a lot of that <unk> for hand, was an important part of the project.
We couldn't deal with the photo unless it was clean and dry and was <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos already <unk>
As he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky in relation to the photos.
I had started <unk> she was stopped and she stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face was not been able to prove it, we were able to break the images into a single picture and tweak the full picture.
When he picked up his pictures shared something of his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures on a department station between the rubble -- quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their children, not as small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
She took a week to find his entire family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her a little kid his son under 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, something that he could remember from the past that was not marked on the last day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to us, <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up by hand over <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- most of us -- the vast majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 families hundreds of photos and <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't spend more than 1,000 in teams and material, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that would take us but the first thing that we would look for.
This is about the project to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone out of their connection to the past.
When a picture like this one comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you get.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- I will give something bigger -- using their talent for something that is not a perfect skin.
To finish this email -- I would like to read this email that I came back from Japan after six months.
As I was born, I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the imagery.
One particular one in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a picture of my family my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of just a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion <unk> but a trillion frames a second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow <unk> of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and it turned on and <unk> it in a <unk> <unk> in various <unk> to create a <unk> package of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet is.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> package and put it into this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower than you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't get this research.   <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts <unk> and that inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the lid and they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights of the top of the top you see in the bottle, after several boxes, that <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common and ordinary bullet and we make them go down the same distance and see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much they think they would take us to see that film?
A day? It's a week? It's actually a year.
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow slow movement.
And what about <unk> nature <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes look at a full composition of course.
But if you look at it once more and more of this <unk> you realize that, as the light stands out of the <unk> it still goes <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is bounces inside it and comes back into a number of <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, you will be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of <unk> it goes very little light.
But we're going to be a billion times faster than the shortest show -- so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took these <unk> data and <unk> them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a superhero would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. You know, they will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique abilities.
It's got very good temporary resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
As a laser project you can record a picture of <unk> you see on the screen, you really don't have any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we're going to go and try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's back on the curve, and in the future.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the interior of the body -- <unk> <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood of this is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new model of visualizing the problems of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself, a scientist, I became science in art, a art of <unk> pictures.
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected every time isn't just for scientific visualization, but we can can be able to do that.
To create a new form of computational photograph with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves, remember, time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are going from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
So it turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have liked to see this image.
The order that events occur in the world are sometimes taking place at the camera.
We put the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
A cell phone can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
You can record a song, you can move it to you and get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that time, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going to come up with a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who are <unk> that they were looking for a change, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who should have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> data in gross.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This board says that every European <unk> every single vendor of all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls the who. Who sends an email to a who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the cell phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and even two years, in your phone company or your Internet provider or your Internet.
And in all Europe people stood and said, "We want that."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone to and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some people even said this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
You can store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> that at the time I was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for me, all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a demand for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end, I agreed.
We demand demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court failed <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly pair of brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> <unk> <unk>
At first I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit disappointed what had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to do that.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Street City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom back and zoom back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to go online to <unk> and how often I call it in the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we're talking about a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one called the other one, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big network of communication.
You can see how people communicate each other to what time they call each other to what time they call each hour.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who send you an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not every single <unk> of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information of us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to get them in forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home and tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and it's not happened in fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that give you to remember that you have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so it would take all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> nor can it <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus -- my mother and not <unk> because my parents were to be brothers, though they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that came at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you from the present to all.
I feel bad for me, because at some point of life, you wish to be a disabled moment.
Let's go for them.
<unk> at Christmas, they're in the shopping mall, drive up in circles for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold.
I'm a <unk> China and woman, and live in New Jersey.
If it doesn't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved myself that my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I want to walk from my home to New York City.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe if they weren't.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents were going to go to the school system and get sick that I also went, and if I don't get all the ultimate note -- all the <unk> the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that I would get it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong, and and ...
Yeah. The first day in the children's garden was walking like a <unk> champion that has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
There's now 20 numbers, and it's still being all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to <unk> <unk> like campaign.
People who grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of fun that died of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three months and no eat, so you stop at the dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> myself.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer summer on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we weren't going to go back to Palestine all the <unk> <unk> us in <unk>
At summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and threw me cups warm up on my back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes, and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I make yoga was an comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents would draw this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital in <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a grant for the University of the State of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the <unk>
All of me would tell me.
I did all the most smart tasks I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in <unk>
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four o'clock at the end of the end will be a <unk>
I have paralysis, <unk>
By the end of the end, we finally did that.
Thank goodness to God <unk> I'm a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater, and crying around historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask why and she told me why she thought I couldn't do the stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts I can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role for the one that was literally born and gave it to an actor.
I was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated from I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> it didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that <unk> directors don't <unk> <unk> <unk> not white disabilities.
It's just perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
And in my first tour, I took up comics in New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he landed at the high speed of New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little <unk> <unk> that says that women are not fun, and they find them very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Film Festival from New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the cable news program behind Keith <unk>
I walked as if I went to a graduate dance dance. I went to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the principal and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the desk of the speaker for not to go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but she was just like <unk> and I taped my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never fall away from me and no older girl.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became object.
<unk> clips online like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite -- my favorite <unk> <unk>
What do you have?
We should really pray for her."
One <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't do someone in <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man. man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors were saying they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we had grown up with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, I would have more hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We probably need all of society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet, by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> this incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in depiction of the great state of New Jersey in <unk> in 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give kids the Palestinian refugee children, a smaller part of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a young people.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no jobs, no perspectives of future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
Maybe a year ago we did anything.
One day you give him a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
It takes a dynamic group of people, which gives him a break.
It gets a little bit of money to get new clothes to get new clothes to send my family home, and your family.
They show a young lady.
Finally, it house.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb car.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city was the suicide bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small village trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for her.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that brought it from what we call the <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> urban youth who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who look for something beyond <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs -- for well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the most high rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't care about opportunities, the history of <unk> <unk> the door of terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of cities 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
And I remember standing at that hospital when I was looking at it, thinking, and if I never would have gone?
And if I'd been forced to be forced to be in that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support the youth leaders at a corporate frequency.
<unk> around 90 Jewish leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had one of ideas of ideas on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me that because he was a graduate university university -- frustrated, it was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely wiped out the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company in <unk>
They started <unk> motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point going to be going down to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool on <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking so young.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, this is the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were all of plastic from the overseas.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of us who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and he started growing <unk> and he said, it could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding creating gardens in houses, and the companies in the city, and now is working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the young people, the young people, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, their innovation, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of the change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> solutions for local problems.
So then inspire young people and create a business spirit culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation for <unk> in developing their business.
They were going to give young people with the resources they need, and the support they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
His Park. That's how it's called, when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent on and keep wearing <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their frugal innovation and have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace that <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not because of the path that we were able to <unk> we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lens lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls from aluminum <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question she kept with me, and he was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you are, who clean our trash <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and for 11 tons of waste and two tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who I do that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked down the road, and I interviewed people in office and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I was not just traveling in the trucks.
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as practical as you think, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very quickly.
It costs a lot of getting used to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every few weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and pass whizzing around you.
They just want to do it, so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the trash also is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It doesn't stop coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always supposed to be moving.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think strongly that <unk> waste is the most important work hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
These are the first beating from public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of a efficient and effective form of each day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers inherent they threaten us in very real ways.
disease that we had been controlled for decades and centuries they come up and start <unk>
The economics needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the engines of economics start to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just by taking place his relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
So I mean just the speed of that we used to move used in <unk>
We usually don't get rid of us or <unk> or we have our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- we forget about them, we forget about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side which is expected to do.
So I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about waste waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste <unk> on the street, grabbed my son and went down the stairs and there was a man making his <unk> journey of paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her this particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe you <unk> I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to realize all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The city waste we think about when we talk about trash, you represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of your days and in your lives, the next one to see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage -- you know, let me take a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our life and community forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other one in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center for a number of stories on the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us like example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the skin <unk> generates heat in the inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that's going from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, it has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, was really enchanted by the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
That's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a whole building, from several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced by the <unk> the site, which is located in a very far area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not existed.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, joining all the inputs of the building.
And this is going on with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the open air in the building that was <unk> by its own way, the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution to <unk> local climate conditions.
And I started thinking of a tissue like a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the entry of the air, and it also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry.
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and the light in a controlled controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center.
But ultimately we realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall because in order there were a lot more profitable to sell.
And in addition to the idea of the facade it was much more economic not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have <unk> air.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a great advantage putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which we have collected water for inner <unk>
It's expected for the early year, since we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that is so big -- the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention to <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen access doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets there, creating 12 early blocks in size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we selected some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors of interconnected with straight lines, and this is the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell cell -- like the apartment, as an <unk> part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we would make a framework that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And also it responds to local standards that set up a greater density in higher levels and a lower density in the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community that occupied space.
It's where all the neighbors, you can upload and <unk> and do such as a run of two miles per morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common focus on the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changing the communities and local economies at the same rate growing the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as target to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I got my sinister sinister sinister plan.
I was a time after the school <unk> I was a little afternoon, and I was stuck in the <unk>
When the coast was exhausted, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's book <unk>
And then I did.
And so we put the ratings out of my <unk> just a little bit, just some of them.
All the same ones,  And I set up to bring the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other roommates had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> notes around the world, without any imagination.
And I put all of the rows out of <unk> and myself a row of that, just because I was there, I would just be there.
I'm still amazed by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got paid.
It's that everything was <unk>
I never told me.
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason that I was bothered by this little girl, so small, it was so good for you."
I was complaining about jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause one of women in the U.S.
And yet, I have never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the laboratory that you study <unk> in all its possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> <unk> no <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
It would have no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> there would be no <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as the <unk> is almost all of them.
This year, 100 years of his <unk> work search for the <unk> study of the <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forgot about what it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious like the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a kind of narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we felt jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
As a storytellers and the audience -- we know exactly what details you were going to do to put the knife <unk> right?
The <unk> make us all <unk> and that is something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she makes to give me pleasure could give to someone else, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds to his collection of torture in his private camera.
You need to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> of the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big bright hair, and the cute little bit of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening to the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover, then it <unk> those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for the truth, really painful truth, in fact, what they <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us to have a range of much more profound feelings and vital that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women who are <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> disclose ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us open back in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion <unk> we <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Do any other emotion that teaches us to look at a intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young woman who was being consumed with the idea that her woman would get it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, that you don't get sick in what your wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or allegedly <unk>
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
And novels described very well how <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to make violent acts of violent or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
One of 52 years of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which I would send messages to itself, for one year.
And for a year, every year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of her former boyfriend. I have to confess that when I or this, I reacted with awe for me.
Because, let's be realistic.
What large, even though they go, creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to get our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what it <unk> is what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take your own and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor of your name, it takes your rings, your cow rings, your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you the whole world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street and ask by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius needs <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they would do it and do it with <unk> in each one of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and then finally in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once you go <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We aren't <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> came in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene also is mysterious, right?
It looks like a problem of geometry without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> gets to admire that idea of being a <unk>
It might still be so dangerous.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to worry about the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as long as we hope that that happens, we remember we have the fiction.
Only fiction <unk> the jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet thing is, the terrifying <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and sold on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the gray surface is the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization in peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of day, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo took work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the program Apollo <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on his surface, which I held up after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you care?
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask why the <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why is the most precious mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why will you fly over the <unk>
Why is he Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West on the east of the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great power to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a very long context of technology <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and eliminated <unk>
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the human history, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with a candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles away.
Since 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the glad optimism on the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems we imagine the technology that would be going to do Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to have a result of it.
I remember the release of the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I don't belong to the escape <unk> of the rocket the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but I was completely sure that I would see the colonies on Mars.
So that thing about it, he happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It seems as if the technologists would have been <unk> and enriched with toys -- things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the sales of it.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But they don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that they have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years when they were <unk> Microsoft, -- Apple and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> specifically, incentives that the venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs to offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of ideas to be created by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worry about the risk, they preferred little investment investment, small investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with profit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and the development of the long-term capital -- they have never invested in developing technologies that are intended to solve big problems because they don't have a safe commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we do not solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic today.
<unk> and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete on price on price.
Now, technologists, managers, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what politics and treaties on international energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an economic policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and systems for food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems -- sometimes we have a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found out there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to fix the problem, the institutions must be able to support the <unk> it must really be a problem and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves these <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition, like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no modern mythology of science fiction as we explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have a problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a big decline of trust, it's a very general belief in it.
The second one is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third one is a <unk> we should regain confidence.
I think the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and could have increased on others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the polls over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and political ones, follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very trustworthy 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half a way.
But is this evidence enough?
What general opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you look at is <unk> attitudes, that people are doing when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
You probably ask for asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust you, in some, but in other no."
What it's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit the confidence in a <unk> fashion.
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official or a person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give you the class, but somehow to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust -- because they try to address the good inherent judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
This is not the goal that I <unk>
I would argue to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are saving their savings with very rightly named Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart objective in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> <unk> that's the right goal.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in raw subjects -- and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But yes, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest -- but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it is, I don't have <unk>
But that's what we're looking at, close before confidence.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to judge.
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build systems from accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional people, and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
And I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, <unk> the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that will go <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we need to think that the system of accountability is destined to ensure the <unk> and the evidence for <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You must all know the similar examples.
Let's get all that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if things would be based on being worthy of trust, and we would give them to people who are reliable and if other people, whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> what doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
And we would take the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust ultimately is <unk> because we give us a lot of other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the losses enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> usually, all the people, all the time.
But you also have to contribute to evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That's a day, everywhere, the common people -- the common people, the <unk> the institutions, so much effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks and says I can ask them without giving them better.
I take them and get my money, or change the color you want.
That's great. I trust them, because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers we've been <unk> we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining how it would be.
First he created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
The designers can tell them their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How can you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Sciences <unk> <unk> with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area.
You know, a transparent bombsight with high-speed cameras to detect your fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, you can get inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in the real space, it's so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that's down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and returned to things by the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head, or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical physicists so that we can be able to <unk> and <unk>
How would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical foundations.
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of quantum levitation and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And when we digitally programmed the object, we release it from time constraints and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and distance and the famous <unk> by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality -- the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the motion of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the text, this is a real and felt experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities of the everyday life.
As you can see, digital information is not only going to show you something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us that we have to <unk> ourselves from our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all expenses saved.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believe that there was only an accurate path to the <unk> a safe and good job of it.
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera company.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio program.
But no adult would give them the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were telling me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more for train.
My dream would never be <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life -- a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one on my way around me wanted to be <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> Nan <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about contemporary Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and to your mother."
I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also led to my <unk> habit.
<unk> lots of perspectives.
For example, this map seemed to me that I found out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There is to research camps like religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading comparative reading work for research, why don't you do it as well as everyday life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> the <unk> are <unk> and political and spiritual ones.
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> path of <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of being lost in translation, I found that you can gain a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be able to feel used or powerless or never.
Having a <unk> dream is really not anything compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
A broken dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So books always have been <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman, named Alex.
And Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw her back on my office and grabbed the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My kind of class had a <unk> like first customer.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy only to move the head as it comes to the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I said, Alex, and for what I looked at, she was right.
You start to work after that, you get home later, you have children after the death later later.
To put it as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with guys underneath your category, but it was <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my assistant, he said, "No, no, but maybe it was <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of recklessness <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they believe that no one comes to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yes. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> <unk> matter.
This is not just my view. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments will be going to be 35 years old.
So this means eight of each 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give his life a way to your life when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> I don't panic.
This audience is going to be OK, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on how many money they <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and they are <unk> to <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change yourself, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top to the 28 and the things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the moment to tell you about your body and your options.
When we think of a child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which his everyday life and common life has a <unk> impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> is listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time in <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
The journalists would tell him <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you read a <unk> in your head, and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely anything.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, interesting things like you or your children, you get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship isn't just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I'm going to start a career.
But then it starts sounding something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts sounding something like this: "My dates for <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around 30, 30, it crashed the music and all started to sit on it.
I didn't want to be the only one to stand stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
So where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but you don't get rid of the risks you're very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure at the '50s and so many of us start a career, pick a city, to choose a city, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once in the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You know, you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see yourself yourself, and me, sitting in the room, and talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said that he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you couldn't decide, so I spent the last years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, he showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living in a very hard time, his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our sessions, but then she was getting up her to say, "You don't choose her family, but he can choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every time.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with her many <unk> but then I stayed looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> by <unk> please call <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if it gives me <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work hard to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade <unk> from Emma passed on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man, or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital of identity makes sense of identity.
So now it's the time for that work of the other side of the country, of that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't count, which by the way, is not exploration, right?
It's <unk>
I told Emma to <unk> jobs and make them tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> that you get together with friends with similar minds are limited in who you know what you know about, how do you think, how do you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out of almost always comes from the outside of its nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak bonds friends of their friends.
Yes, half of them have a bad job or they don't have any work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the work that we created never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed you don't choose his family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma will soon join her family when you have a couple and form your own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit down than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person you live right now, or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook starts to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you do, and that means to be as intentional in love as you're in the workplace.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or kill any time with anyone who owns them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> roommate who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who she alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special from events in museums.
He's married to a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I sent me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to make.
<unk> are like aircraft coming out of the airport from Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in your trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> you know.
It's as just as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege to say to <unk> like every day: <unk> -- not the new <unk> <unk> his <unk> get their <unk> get their bonds and use their weak bonds choose your family.
Don't define what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they did not know or what they didn't know or what they
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very difficult job in <unk> <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to graduate students in New York City in New York City.
And as any teacher, I set tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I work on, I will reduce grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have <unk> I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that set me to think.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in the mathematics in seventh grade, sure, it's <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time.
After several years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
But what if we succeed in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of rough scenarios and every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids are going to do, the farther possible in competition.
We studied <unk> professors who are working in the very difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, asking ask what of these marketers are going to keep their job work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came up with a trait as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is a passion and resilience to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to her future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who were doing questionnaires and then I waited for about a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when they <unk> them in every single feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of <unk> <unk> even the safety of the children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk.
To me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little the science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How can we develop purpose in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, ultimately determination is not related or even relates to talented <unk>
Up until now, the best idea I've heard about developing determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn not to learn it is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, and we need to be willing to fail, and start all new with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, <unk> the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
So from that moment, I was overwhelmed by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single character of every single character on the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic science.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read the basic traffic signals signals of restaurants, and understand the basic idea of web pages or the newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it could be possible until it's <unk>
They take a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person in both sides, as if I was screaming at a <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of cake but I like to believe it's the other shape -- which is the way it works.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks to create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are <unk>
If a person hits your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>   -- you know, you know, a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two fireworks together, it becomes very hot.
Three mm together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Did you get a guy at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight eight eight of them will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing you learn about a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is an sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is the east of China.
So one sun along the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains, stacked mountains over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the hell has become a date.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind you that I must stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz in Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand to it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of a child fantasy <unk>
And yet, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took up for 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy, and a guy named <unk> a girl dressed as <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz would do today, the magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the <unk> generated by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the female magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son of a child.
Just three years.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  And so she was struck in the room and was impressed as a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but I was going to get it all the way away.
I wonder what <unk>
Would it be themes of value, resilience and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke was one of the army to <unk> the government?
This is the <unk> of <unk>
How do you win Dorothy your film?
We do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to be <unk> and not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force that brings strength in the movies for our children, and so little on the path of bricks to <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know from experience that princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first one, I really expected them to go out and come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why don't you go there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the villain and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they kids, they are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to defend them, but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war movies out.
Of course, the most successful topic of all times is still coming up in classic <unk> every one of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until a lot of you are thinking about this year, it finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when you came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films passes the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not messed down, and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> In the film, there is more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to get the requirement.
These women speak each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid than you like it?  All right?  All right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus from what is a <unk> movie film.
<unk> does not the test of <unk>
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the hostage.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back into the numbers.
In 2011, of the most popular movies how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then is okay.
But there's a number bigger than this one that goes to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say.
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted once in their life.
I don't think it's the <unk> of the mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music music or pornography are closely coupled with, but when I hear that <unk> one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't you get to <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat hell, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this <unk> statistic and we want to take it out.
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> it goes to <unk> yes, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way of doing something really important, and I'm talking mainly about parents.
I think we have to show our kids who are a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the masculinity is changing radically.
You've read about how new economy is changing the role of the home of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star character from "Star <unk> Do you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these guys have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I read to my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where her work looked like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the magician in <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I thought about was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I joined <unk>
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I can see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1,300 miles along the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place -- simple seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we can use it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian companies.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find a <unk> old city, called <unk> losing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles, but somewhere inside this enormous continuous <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, The Nile <unk> right on the side of <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And to try to find out at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data for NASA to make a place, with very subtle changes.
And we were able to see where we would get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that looks within the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date from the Ottoman Empire exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and quartz and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common rocks in the <unk> of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite elite shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find any <unk> here, but we would go to the place in a near future.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to TED it was not founded in 1984 A.D., C.
Do ideas actually have been done in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the gate, the material that's made.
Now you can see a group of obese <unk> in bicycles.
They're competing in a <unk> race and they're going to address their door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of their home.
There is bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> places the threshold of the door, <unk>
So the <unk> the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of light. The light glows on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair -- on a brown horse from it.
It's a horse that he talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you see that it's about getting into the mouth.
They put on a side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making most of your imagination, you imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over the center, singing <unk> <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow building path and from the oven.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that is done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a few years ago -- waiting, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk>
There were several men and a few <unk> ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
Give it whole poems in just just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using some old <unk> techniques that were invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used to be used to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval academic used to memorize books for <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no ear <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful man, and brilliant English -- although a little <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live on national T.V.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me me.
I mean, you have to start with something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what the potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see what point our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> in him based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went a afternoon together in the public library from Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk>
And to come back, a number of treaties on the memory memory makes something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of things really interesting.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> memory <unk> and that's not one thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would argue that they have changed a cognitive <unk>
Because we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people still find people who are passionate about this idea of <unk> <unk> memory, which is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not as <unk> there is a lot like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College London invited a group from memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Will it be that it has brains in a way, or <unk> different structural or different <unk>
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery of <unk> and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of snow found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> <unk> is driving as an armed career.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who he's about to try to memorize it in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all of the techniques used by the end, it gets reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates that with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, "You know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you to <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
You know, what do you do?"
The person who told her that his name is Baker is a <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that their job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
All the other memories you dance about your head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were okay when they come home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back 2,500 years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
History says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired as a entertainment, because before, if they wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring to a <unk> they would be fed to a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> his memory poem, and he <unk> and so soon it was, the hall was <unk>
Tell us all.
But not only the killed all of them, but it shattered the bodies.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so you could not get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, shut my eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting every single <unk>
I took the family family <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What you have <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you let me tell me that the first 10 words in the story I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to tell them to say who sitting on the horse a brown horse in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with your eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to tell the -- the more crazy -- the more crazy -- the more crazy -- and <unk> -- is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the early memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, in the same way you would have done it, if they'd been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And you will come up with some sort of image absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and seeing the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind that anecdote <unk> that you want to count.
And then I fly in the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word by word, which is going to confuse but typical by typical.
In fact, the <unk> term comes from Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of space terms.
The phrase <unk> first would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got filled with that.
I went to some of these <unk> and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of <unk> competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that's going on is when someone was sitting on the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was fun.
I would never hope I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is to improve increasingly and more and more ability to create and imagine these images that are proposing cartoons, <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard standard training for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a <unk> <unk> covered just leaving two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory of memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that had been covered in a year before. He had the idea that he could go in, in some sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone phone phone numbers, and you actually don't have the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be put out to build memory <unk> or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift -- but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focused deeply.
The palace of the <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they don't even panic.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what I would do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human in front of us, who is walking around our side. We will be so <unk> that we didn't even be able to process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to tell you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so you can just turn it into a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> <unk> I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that sharing with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time watching the television television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, all of me looked at me and every time I <unk> and I would go back in a towel -- all of me saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not insecure and <unk>
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's not about division of areas, but of those <unk> emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell them, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it so based on a building a 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> which uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
You see, these stable, stable solid, in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are doing the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library -- which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has this <unk> he's got this big thing, and columns -- red brick <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and share.
So how is it that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, both of them are so different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects who are constantly driving new technologies, new solutions for the forms of life today.
And we kind of push it and we got a lot of the way away that we get away from the people.
And all of the black, you think we think we're very good, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We need to go on the other side and go back to the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experiment with <unk> we do <unk> the pendulum back over and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was born in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really hard.
So we zoom in to the '80s, and we started adding those symbols.
I put the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that like and <unk>
<unk> neon and added bake to use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into <unk> which can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> they won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started doing <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new <unk> design techniques and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that we were involved against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is completely <unk>
Normally the pendulum <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academic and public <unk> were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times Times <unk> this <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when the building ended up.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these forms -- wild and <unk> how is it possible that they will become ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened, because the media went around and quickly we learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created a emotional reaction with these forms.
The main narrative of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new third country with another star.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all architecture. The digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is getting beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take very precise time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, 8, or 100 buildings, before I knew if the one who designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been a good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year movement and 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the people are going to be.
That's never going to happen. Because we are on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the media to media, it starts to <unk> more and faster, until you get into both extreme extremes of <unk> and you actually get the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional loads of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the surface, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started getting to and they shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a medium of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but that has changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in these librarians of <unk>
If that building was built up today, you would first build on the Internet for <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what can a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can bring to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no single answer to what a library might be in today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
<unk> are no longer these mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and such complicated, and you're not a <unk> public who doesn't accept something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get rid of the architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one another, of one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of historical brick based on ideas that should be a <unk>
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also it can serve for sport or for <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream for swimming on the East <unk> East in New York, and raising half a million dollars of the infected community around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion as <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build what we build.
<unk> already know how to make more green buildings smarter and more kind.
We have been waiting for everyone you want.
Finally, we're not in opposite directions.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them way back to the <unk> spaces of local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year, and he started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big fat kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. And then when you couple of doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at online, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
And what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow school roommates told him, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he publishes others to stop a <unk> "I'm a nice or <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal healthy teenage teenager who gets these answers into one of the most vulnerable life stages.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their most most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
We never have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young, so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures.
This environment, of being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of <unk> that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no division of a life online and the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is to be done.
What is the top of someone else's lives, what is normal in a everyday context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover of girls now.
<unk> zero <unk> remain <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who do it, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people want?
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the usual <unk> stars, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, to the price of every other aspect of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical issues, their studies and other aspects are starting to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, as <unk> to society and to the field of working development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One in five are not going to be <unk> at all of the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the computer season, if you don't think you look at it well, specifically if you don't think that you are enough, enough, you put a smaller note on the average of your fellow who you don't care about what you think about it.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it does irrespective of what these young people actually weigh these young.
So, to make it well of course, we're talking about as you see you, not how you're really like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> <unk> less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy that they can take them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all about all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic relationships to early times, and no protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not doing it.
Women who believe they have <unk> again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be <unk>
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
And these six aspects are critical points for anyone willing to provide a education in self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take the burden on the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
It's challenging the status of how women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians to the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judging the people so they are, not because they see.
All of us can start by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you. When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to save their entire person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are really marking the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
Your <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is at two seats. What would it mean for her if she was released from that <unk> voice, and he would remind him for not to have a long legs, she would get more <unk> plus <unk> a smaller <unk>
What would it mean for her to do this, and we would say it allows its potential to that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is telling us all.
But let's give our kids the truth.
And so the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and for what they do, and because they make us feel.
It impacts the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age of today, will become safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense Department <unk>
<unk> initially <unk> but being prisoner for other charges in the company of others, they started planning attacks about 12 icons from New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. base.
And luckily, those plans were <unk> by an FBI informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb charges in the World Trade Center, couldn't be treated.
Later it would be convicted of your participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving mother, an American mom, teacher teacher in the two made everything possible for giving me a happy childhood <unk>
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims, will get known.
By experience that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to want to want the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in all of the human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think we need to use all the possible media so that everybody lived like them.
A few months before arrest him sat with me and explained that in the last weekends he sat up with me and explained that in the last weekends he and some friends had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go to the next day.
We got to the <unk> of throwing <unk> which, without knowing our group, was taken by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to the goal for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that <unk> I gave the little orange light over the goal, and to surprise you, especially mine, all the goal broke on flames.
My uncle went back to the rest and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a kid.
All of all, the commentary was a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what it was so funny.
Did you see me in me, the same level of destruction that my father could imagine.
Those people later would be condemned by putting a <unk> kilos of explosives in the northern tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved back 20 times. That instability during my childhood didn't let me do a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone already was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class that was often the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white thing, but it will be the new of the quiet class and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on home reading books, watching TV or playing games.
For these reasons I did not have social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't ready for the real world.
I was raised opera to judge people, based on indicators and <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way of thinking, was during presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I participated in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> on the subject of juvenile violence as I had been the victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something that felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys we had done friendship, was Jewish was.
It took several days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend before, and I really felt very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that my entire life was had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, but exactly the way I wish I wish to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I could contrast to the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart was going to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my focus on a moment where I was desperately excited about.
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with his eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which even though I joined this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it for the victims of terrorism and because of their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts without meaning, as a <unk> to the actions of my father.
And with this <unk> I put it here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, that the children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I am not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has anything, flavor and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your <unk> <unk>
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie that you, you and you.
There's nothing you know about directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I don't sure you are conscious.
<unk> is also the reason for living.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that we have to do to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
We need to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature, is objective to objective it.
<unk> by nature, is subjective stuff.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I would have that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior -- neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, all started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of wonderful work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of life.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain about consciousness. The questions about what makes certain areas of the brain and what it was <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I didn't offend the <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how they operate <unk> how <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how the target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a known phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we do -- how do we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't still have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work for a long time, and I was beating my head on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of consciousness that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for some of the reasons.
I think we're going to be <unk> at this point.
We have a beautiful chain of amazing explanations -- we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate our scientific worldview, the world.
I think consciousness, I think consciousness, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first, rather than being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan <unk> who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a sort of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions to understand the behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything you need to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a pure awareness theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time I have -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists, sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> buildings, the space and the mass.
They make fundamental laws than <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
On the contrary, it becomes principles, and it's built the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental thing is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't tell the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- time, time, mass law, and the laws of Newton. So applied the basic laws of <unk> and applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws have.
I think that's the situation we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- which is space, time, mass mass, all the <unk> -- so much of the logic, you have to <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect with consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the time, the mass, the physical processes.
physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anxiety when he thinks "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some <unk> element of feeling a very primitive precursor to consciousness.
This might sound a little crazy for you.
How did someone think something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we think with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Because there's always information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, an complex.
<unk> of simple data, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it <unk> with methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be about consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration of information, just quite significant, very significant <unk>
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller and it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.
physicists and philosophers and often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
You know, the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the bottom.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, where is the fire of <unk>
From the <unk> view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts it into equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to celebrate our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I had not to eat anything that I had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you embrace that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think that you tend to transform your dreams, while what matters in ethical terms and moral terms, is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the <unk> movie.
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are doing a pretty serious ethical problems about the development ethic of the development of smart computers and the <unk> ethics systems.
And finally, you can ask for the awareness of specific <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED Talk, and right now, we have an collective collective consciousness, an inner film for this whole group of TED, different of the <unk> movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure of the first crazy idea, which consciousness is something fundamental -- than the second thing is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was excited with my friends, I was stuck with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to give it for a community <unk>
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yeah. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
And years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, so just after about 20 minutes in the class of 11 studies, a boy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when you get your <unk>
I said, "What did you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when he realized, this child had had experience with people with inspiration objects.
And we don't are. And it's not the <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability aren't our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- I think I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, it has been sold to us the lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk> <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable for you.
It's not something bad and it can't make you think.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more that lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without the hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call porn.
And I use the porn term <unk> because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would give the disabilities to benefit from people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, because of a bad thing that my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been excited to say that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was excited to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are given to people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't that bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
And we got a few things.
But the things that we die aren't the things that you can think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I joined the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabilities because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned how much of your ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of it.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to do in the way we do it, sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold to us this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, I don't do that.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to upload the cell phone battery on the chair of the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but to a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really think that that lie that you've sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not real, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a stretch of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability isn't the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a two-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered <unk> nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we will be <unk> to wake up on bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value achievement in people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a boy of 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised than his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do to know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and the mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds -- we were excited about trying to <unk> it with all his being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I put some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> <unk> idea is an underwater rising to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> on the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be your favorite players -- and they have asked me on YouTube and <unk> and he can see from the angle of a field <unk>

We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we go to the next <unk>
We take it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people know already.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you get a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of Adrian <unk>
When he can be <unk> running by the <unk> throw the ball to the bottom of the <unk> or <unk> by doing a <unk>
What will be your experience when you hit a mountain to over 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe she <unk> women's sales for adults.
But this is not yet yet yet.
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality -- augmented reality when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on the technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore members of Baltimore had a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to be <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next step shown in front of you, in a plastic bar that you wear on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or the <unk> strategy.
It's just going to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want to, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality isn't just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game to play the game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You can also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all of that information, you send to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This is going to make good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just to nerds.
It will also be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
It took the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would remind you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> typically, you don't know, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have a open receptor here.
They took the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we can land. But the receptor sees its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and change the race.
<unk> capture <unk> runs and runs out.
The public <unk> and fans have followed it from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show you how bad the actions of the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology worth in a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it true for a <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently moved to me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the end of the south <unk> County, which includes the Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to map of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its inspirational architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who was building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, that every ever from it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one drop of four to five seconds, the body goes against water about 120 miles an hour.
The <unk> impact on bone, some of which will provide vital organs.
Most of them die in an impact.
The ones that not, they usually lie in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that those who are going to take this method of suicide -- you realize <unk> death to the one that <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the most dark time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
And I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successful that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official <unk>
This is Jason <unk>
I met him this last year from Shakespeare's last year when they receive a call of a possible subject of a suicide bomber sitting in the passenger near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with an official of the Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and there was flown back here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to get suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right and gone.
This kind and clever kid in New Jersey had just gotten to life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had been asked by <unk>
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What do you think?
What is that?
In my experience, you don't only have to talk, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel it, because you probably don't know.
You just stand there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think someone is <unk> you won't be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have been thought of finishing life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do to <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I got to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he was with her permission and his blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go up to the bridge this week.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends that tell their friends, so on.
I'm still quite excited about, but even more moments of realizing that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
It never came there.
I called the police in <unk> and I would break it down like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the <unk> car was down on the bridge.
A witness I had seen it jump from the bridge to the afternoon of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go on the path that her son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March of March 2005, I wrote a radio call for a possible subject on the sidewalk <unk> near the north.
I put my hole on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing in the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he noticed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and half the next, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back to that lane and give it to another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what made it to do, and I loved the hope and life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
And let me talk to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother's mom, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to get you to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the events of 11 and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months -- completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
<unk> debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she write, <unk> when I visited General San Francisco at night, you would get <unk> as the patient.
I know I know what I did.
Kevin is a <unk> father.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression that his story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found on the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather would be <unk>
That act, even though I finished his own pain, I'm theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who think about suicide, they wouldn't think to hurt someone else.
They simply want their own pain.
Usually this is achieved by three things: to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and phone calls around the bridge.
In those incidents where I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those who have jumped on the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave on the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be able to use to do.
suicide can prevent.
There is help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question you want. How do you become that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with me.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that <unk> I'm very beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the <unk> value to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo -- what's considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is my own.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I would always wear this t-shirt in the head.
And my mom was going, "Why would you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew then how to do that?
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never told you to share my story, not because I think it's going to be a bad thing, but how the world comes to those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have my mom, Dad and family who take me like am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in culture that celebrates the mystery mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a British goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something called me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the principal of a contest of <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if you were <unk> she was <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won a <unk> I won in a <unk> and I was a third <unk> between 40 candidate <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly I was inside the world of beauty <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was the queen of beauty of women, but I can do that.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when he went to remote provinces of the <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 -- my mom. who had moved to San Francisco, and he called me and told me that they passed my application for the green card that I could go live to the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, he called me and said to me, "You know if you're going to ask the United States, you can change the name and your identity <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me in Thailand to 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the world's most rural cities, to do the most sophisticated surgery and safe surgery.
In the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that you live in.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November, we make a global vigil <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help the other to live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day there is no longer 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first, thank you all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family, which I know is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to <unk> young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I would take the phone, called my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, it's not just <unk> it's just <unk> that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned to a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table with the subject that sometimes that task is not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very sweet <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, tribal societies, parents are usually known for their children, but I am one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for defending his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the <unk> National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the history of <unk> in violence and violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when I was born, a little girl, his birth not <unk>
It's not welcoming or his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes up, gives her <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of a <unk> a little girl.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, the first child, gets it sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when he <unk> his third child, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the <unk> mother, but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it goes home and school for her siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with his friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes in adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you want to get out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and her brothers and her family and her family, and if he <unk> the code of that of course, honor, it might even kill it.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of her life and the happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one rule more than <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl must be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts their father and their mother and their mother decisions even if they don't want.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man, you have to <unk> because you don't want to be <unk>
If you get a young woman, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then he gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> de <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I got married, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half and a half, I was <unk> in my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I should <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they <unk> the form of Canada, and he was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I went to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I was encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to deal with her personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
I put my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught them to the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk> lesson.
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was a lethal human rights for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of involvement in all of political and economic activities and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
It was <unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have about those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, I got up and got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, in the BBC, he offered her himself for the New York Times, and he talked to him every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and December December 2012, he was shot in his head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between the life and death, I was told by the ear of my wife -- <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't give you."
<unk> the right cause.
<unk> your life in the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
So these few words would take a lot to me, and I didn't get back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that <unk> through my wife's face.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to give you right. Please don't give up.
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he doesn't just run his job.
They fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so virtuous and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut your wings and that is it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> But all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma <unk> when you get to a brain operation here.
You're still as smart or no?
From not being like that, you might be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from over a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if you didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I have had to decide about all the combinations and <unk> and try to do it to follow alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a alma mater, so I decided that I would try to try and get the <unk> dose, because there really isn't a clear map that will tell you in <unk>
I started trying to test it with different mixes and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the narrow <unk> drastically <unk> my sense of who I was -- my way to think, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and chemicals in the front of an 1900s, and I was amazed by looking at how to fix my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out the end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was getting a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that I had in front of it, and it just didn't.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to do, since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is, by setting those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think of almost always images, and that became my key reference point, how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
We were going to be like <unk> <unk> and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are those who <unk> this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me, is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to thought and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the right point, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> which is really very sophisticated and well <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these very fast images, of my mind to the screen screen on the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use your imagination only to lead the world that is <unk>
Or if a musician could extract music from his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in the early neuroscience.
Both of them used technology, MRI technology, functional MRI to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The one column in the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by the contents of the central column on the left of the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine looking at that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the University of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into brain visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it was shown to people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they <unk> their brains to create a huge array of reactions in the brain facing video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
The computer using only the brain information scanning the scan of it, to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us out.
We're right close to it.
We just need to make resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you can imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was conducted with the largest brain scanning brain scanning systems today, and its resolution is a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer you for that.
A lot of them are proposing new <unk> techniques to images, even I <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the path.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets, but at this point, <unk> magnets only offer small improvements on the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than bigger <unk> make better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
But most advances in recent advances in <unk> and brilliant and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> radio frequently in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field, you can see magnetic patterns and <unk> the frequencies of radio <unk>
So as we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio radio processing -- we can increase the information that can be taken into a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even neural activity. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
Let me tell you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay end."
I think we all have <unk>
Their closet maybe tell you to someone for the first time you love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever through in life.
Everything is a difficult conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal stuff.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> I was a restaurant in the South Side <unk> and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be <unk> by the <unk> of my pants <unk> and I had my head on my head -- I would usually ask a child -- "Hey, you're usually a kid or <unk>
And they would find silence uncomfortable at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The dad <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother, <unk> a cold, look at her son.
But I would never say anything, and I went through it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place for three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
It was a family silence -- but this time was ready and I was about to enter the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> dates <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
So I took it deep and I went down and down to my back, a little girl with a pink dressed staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're <unk> or <unk>
And so it took a little bit back again, and I put it up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is messy.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw <unk> but I am a girl, you know, I'm a girl, you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm a little bit of the kind of girl in a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he's got a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. Just "Oh, too. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, we were both <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls are.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's like my closet is not different from you or you or your yours.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet that was more difficult than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> which is hard to be <unk>
It's hard to be hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared online banking is harder to say it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, just there's the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what's hard to do to the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse, one dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the <unk> lesbian <unk> to fight for any <unk> kid who would go in coffee.
I was frozen by the fear of fear, I was standing in a corner of my dark closet -- I was going to get my grenade out of my background, gay, and the move only a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers who have spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was turning around on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed by so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> to kill you.
And one of my graduate launches was the most memorable wedding in my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of us were invited to know that I was gay, and when I do my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally got to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me about years ago.
And after a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it <unk>
Do you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your TV show.
Our <unk> Will Will Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting for me to let me know her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts at all.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where you felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, it's <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to <unk>
And that's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk> <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves going to go out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl on the coffee didn't have armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other needs to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk>
If you know you're gay, you know.
If they tell their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex <unk>
You communicate your truth.
You would never get rid of that.
And some of them can be hurt safe -- so they have done, but they're never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours alone.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark myself, you would have a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but you're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether an underwater can be able to <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer pioneers as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I had a program to try and understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but you have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and you have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as a <unk> we know the reason that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that you don't have any concept about the Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that you put on the surface of a planet -- you can stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be fixed for developing intelligence development, and in particular, for the development of no universal states that we would expect the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the robots of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I said, from doing several years ago, there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of one E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the choice open with a force, with the diversity of potential accessible, and it does even an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the alternative open.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I'm thinking, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have been suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have trend more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from it.
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you meet in it.
Amazingly, <unk> could go through multiple animal intelligence, to play in human intelligence, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without the wrong thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human foot -- here we see <unk> <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for his balance to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for <unk> <unk> and human aid technologies.
This ability to use tools are going to have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling off opposite edges of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has really interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For instance, here you can successfully play a <unk> game, against itself, <unk> your potential for play.
So here we look at <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the network very well.
This same capacity to network network also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the pathways of a fleet of boats, and discovering success and using Panama Panama to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we look at <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a very simulated series of analog action, successfully increasing assets under its exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have huge application for finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of virtual human behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the use of the word <unk> the work -- there was always the concept that if you were <unk> intelligent machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion there.
The machines were encouraged against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> rebellion in reverse.
It's not that machines are becoming very smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take the control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that the general intelligence can actually emerge directly from control instead of being the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
And they often ask me, how do you look for targets <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence -- is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the decline of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the <unk> intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they sort of block the light out of it.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there is between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets -- and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At their time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from a millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist in the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I look for aliens opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet, and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a world that is potentially livable that this is a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and part of it that we studied so much about Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer only short space flights -- but also the <unk> <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> you remind deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and the ideas that are linked to the ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extent of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain by <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places on the Earth, the air is fresh and filled with oxygen that we have gone through our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement over the colonization of Mars and other planets will end up with a big and sad deal, the implication and the belief that some of Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is really livable the Earth.
For a lot of you like the exploration, I am in profound disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party actually will be a place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Fermi Fermi asked me, having realized that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found some evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets is to protect the origin of the planets that we will develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization we can save ourselves from ourselves, but <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I had no keys.
In fact, I could see out the window that were on the dining table where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty moved.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> might take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night, because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I <unk> my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but it's sure that it's not more expensive than a <unk> at a half of the night, so I thought, even though I was in the circumstances, I was very well over.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rate, and you sell the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I had no passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which was going to be bad things to happen.
Or at least if bad things happen, you know, <unk> the probability of a total catastrophe ...
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't work.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed to tell him about I was broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight with me.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this about a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, and then try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious things.
At the house, it <unk> a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of important things, where the fish are, where the fish, the <unk> trees live where female tribes live, and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows you to <unk> you find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that are moving around.
This is the reason for you to lose your car keys, <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your <unk> a particular <unk>
For your reading glasses, a particular <unk>
If you put a place and they're <unk> with it -- your stuff will always be there when you <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards a picture of your credit card <unk> <unk> <unk> by mail that you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your brain.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
